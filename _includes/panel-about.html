        <p>Brilliant, bubbly, and beautifully nerdy, I don't wait to be entertained; I'll start the conversation, make you laugh, and invite you into the moment. I love connection&mdash;the kind where you feel seen and heard, and deeply. The sort of genuine coupling where our affection lingers in your mind long after we say goodnight.</p>
        <p>Whether seeking companionship is new to you, or companionship with a trans woman specifically, I create a space where exploring our unique chemistry unfolds at your pace, with grace and without pressure.</p>

        <p class="align-center"><a class="button" href="{% link index.html %}#contact"><span class="fa fa-solid fa-icon fa-pen-nib"></span> Let's connect</a></p>

        <h2 id="experienced-enthusiastic-confident-confidant">Earnest, enthusiastic, confident confidant</h2>
        <p>For me, intimacy is the practice of trust, timing, and tension. Every shared look, touch felt, and word spoken is a deliberate choice, a dance in spaces between confidence and curiosity.</p>
        <p>I believe pleasure is most profound when wrapped in the comfort of safety, yet without sacrificing the thrill of adventure. Our connection will be compassionate and cuddly, not chaotic. </p>
        <p>I'm bubbly, witty, playful, kind, and unapologetically curious about everything, especially you. Make me yearn for you by being as uninhibited and free-spirited in my presence as I am in yours.</p>
        <p>Meet me at my well-equipped private spaces in NYC and Boston, or bring me to you for a rendezvous as limitless as our imaginations.</p>

        <p class="align-center"><a class="button" href="{% link index.html %}#availability"><span class="fa fa-solid fa-icon fa-hotel"></span> Explore Availability</a></p>
        

        <h2 id="more-about-your-companion">More about your companion</h2>
        <p>I'm fit, freckled, and fascinated by the way technology, touch, and emotion intersect. I have skin softer than silk and equally soft hair in curly red ringlets, with a mind sharper than a diamond's edge.</p>
        <p>Maybe you've guessed: science fiction (Star Trek or Star Wars‚ÄîI'm not religious!), cyberpunk retro tech, techno beats, and vintage video games are my happy places. There are depths to discover about how I've become "<a href="{% link _faq/about-me/qr-code.md %}">the girl with the QR code tattoo</a>."</p>
        <p>I'm obsessed with projects that keep my brain spinning as fast as my wheels. My current fixation? Navigating cryptocurrency charts and blockchain rabbit holes. I'm the rare girl who appreciates both a perfectly executed <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> <em>and</em> a perfectly paired wine. </p>
        <p>Nerdy? Perhaps. But decoding patterns whets my appetite for discovery&hellip;in all its forms.</p>

        <p>My candy coating comes in a couple flavors, but poise and courage season them all.</p>
        <p>Catch me running the pool table in my skirt&mdash;and my skates! Feel how I shift between rooftop cocktails and dive bar mischief.</p>
        <p>I'm not new to power exchange. I've studied it, lived it, brought it to life in clubs from Brooklyn to Berlin.</p>
        <p>Want to explore your dominant side? I get kinkier than my curls. Years in leather and BDSM circles taught me control and surrender are a language‚Äîone I'm fluent in.</p>
        <p>Whether you're looking for an oasis of affection, something deliciously darker, or a unique mix of sweetness and spice, I'm your perfect power princess, not a passive pillow princess.</p>
