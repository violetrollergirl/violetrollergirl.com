        <p>Spending quality one-on-one time is lovely, but if you're looking for some more <em>plug and play</em> fun, or to roll up with a crew, I got you, boo. I do so very much love sharing, and being shared. Here, you'll find a range of options for having fun in various configurations. And do let me know if you'd like to see me with a provider who isn't listed. Let's develop an expansion pack together&hellip;.</p>
