        <p>Spending quality one-on-one time is lovely, but are you looking for some more <em>plug and play</em> fun, or to roll up with a crew? I got you, boo. I can coordinate threesomes (or moresomes) in a range of various configurations with the following extraordinary providers. And please <a href="#contact">let me know</a> if you'd like to see me with a provider who isn't listed; we could develop an expansion pack together&hellip;.</p>
