        <p>As an extrovert with a chronic case of wanderlust, I travel frequently and sometimes suddenly. Advance planning helps to avoid rolling the dice on our stars aligning. My <a href="#tours-and-travel-calendar">travel calendar</a> is updated from time to time, and reflects my best estimate of where I&rsquo;ll be. Unmarked days are flexible, so suggest a date via <a href="#contact">my booking form</a>.</p>

        <p>As I have autonomy over my time, with proper planning I can often be available at most times of the day or night. That said, I&rsquo;m not a morning kitten, and <strong>planning our date 2 or more days in advance will give us the best experience together.</strong> I'm discerning and selective, so while <a href="#short-notice-availability">same-day sessions</a> are possible, I always prioritize returning friends and longer bookings over short-notice quickies with new friends.</p>

        TODO: I should add some nice photos of my incalls here.

        <p>I can host us in my <a href="{% link index.html %}#tech-spec-home-cities">home cities</a>&hellip;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>in NYC: several private options near public transit lines, including a luxury condo and decadent dungeon</li>
            <li>in Boston/North Shore: a quiet house with a dedicated kinky play room</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Showers (<span class="icon fa-solid fa-shower"></span>) and easy parking (<span class="icon fa-solid fa-square-parking"></span>) are available at all my incalls in both cities.</p>
        <h3 id="outcall-availability">Outcall Availability</h3>
        <p>If you would like to host:
        <ul>
            <li>I require round-trip fare for car service (including 20% tip for drivers) in addition to my usual <a href="#rates">rate</a> paid up front.</li>
            <li>For safety, I only meet new friends for the first time at a 4- or 5-star hotel, not at their personal residence. If you would like to book me for outcalls to your home, please first book a <a href="#rate-add-ons-and-online-social-only-date">social-only date</a> so that we may get comfortable with one another.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="hotel-arrangements">Hotel arrangements</h3>
        <p>If you're unable to host an outcall, I'm happy to arrange a hotel meet (with minimum 24 hours notice).</p>
        <p>Suitors who want to really impress me should consider adding an amount with which to tip the hotel's housekeeping/maid service. (I notice when people don't tip, and I will in their stead.)</p>
        <h3 id="short-notice-availability">Short notice availability (<a href="{% link _faq/booking/are-you-available-right-now.md %}"><span class="icon fa-solid fa-circle-question"></span> &ldquo;u avail?&rdquo;</a>)</h3>
        <p>My affinity for spontaneity makes same-day trysts occasionally possible <acronym title="If and only if">IFF</acronym> seeing one another is convenient for me. When booking with short notice (less than 24 hours), please keep in mind:
        <ul>
            <li>lack of foreplanning may incur a rush fee to cover last-minute higher lodging or travel costs.</li>
            <li>new friends are still <a href="#screening-options">required to screen</a>, which may take time, so I encourage you to get pre-screened if you often need this kind of spontaneous appointment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Occasionally, I publish last-minute availability on social media; my <a href="#links-socials-amp-content">Links page</a> shows you where you can find and follow me online.</p>
