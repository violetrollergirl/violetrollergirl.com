# Cybersecurity Consultations: Digital Safety and Online Privacy for Sex Workers

Hi there. If you're reading this page, you've probably been steered here by a friend, colleague, or directly by me to learn more about my highly personalized cybersecurity consultations for fellow sex workers. This part of my website is a little bit hidden, but not secret.

## I saw something the Priests of High Tech wanted to keep secret

For anyone who cares to look, it's clear that I have a lot of background in the tech sector. Some of that experience was in civ jobs, but most of it came as a byproduct of my life circumstances, personal affinities, and the mother of all invention, necessity.

Before I started doing sex work, I was a very stubborn advocate for gender justice, trans rights (suuuuch a good ally&mdash;&ldquo;still cis, though&rdquo;), and progressive sex education. I made my views known loudly, earlier than many others were willing to speak about these issues in the way that I was, and this unsurprisingly earned me some enduring ire.

Thankfully, I also had the support from a technically savvy community that helped me practice and perfect the techniques needed to stay relatively safe online and off. Through good old fashioned scrappy resourcefulness and perseverance, I learned an extraordinary amount about digital defenses in a trial by fire environment that forged a unique blend of compassion and conviction for the power and promise of what digital tooling can do for (or against) marginalized communities.

In so many ways, I was very lucky. I got a peek at the gatekept holy books from the metaphorical priests of High Tech. But I am not a loyal disciple. I was and will always be a slutty sinner. Now, I want to help you learn what you need to know to keep yourself and your loved ones safer in an age where technology has become both the pen and the sword.

## A protection spell, not a checklist

I offer one-on-one consultations to help you assess your personal online privacy posture, improve your digital security hygiene, and work with you to instill new and safer habits when you are using digital devices. You don't need another checklist, but rather someone who will actually listen to your real concerns, and knows how to help you filter down the endless list of things you could do to the high-priority things you should do. Someone with whom you can practice, and trust.

You can think of this service as half therapy for your relationship with technology generally, half personal trainer for your digital practices of all stripes, and half cyber-sorcery apprenticeship. With me, you'll learn more than just how to use safety tools. You'll also become familiar with arcane knowledge and gain transferrable skills that underpin all kinds of security evaluations, useful in a bewildering range of contexts from the needs of individuals to enterprise organizations, or even large groups of people who share a political goal.

This is the same service I offer for civ clients, but at much reduced (sliding scale) rates for fellow verified SWers. I also occasionally teach groups in workshop settings, but the one-on-one consultations are highly personalized, and kept strictly confidential. It can be as revealing or intimate as you are comfortable, without any pressure to disclose anything you don't want to.

## It's like a booking, but only our computers start vulnerable

If you want to discuss meeting with me for this purpose, the only way to get in touch is via [Signal Private Messenger](https://signal.org/). If you don't have that, you're going to need it, so go get that now. I don't discuss the details of this over any other messaging channel.

Signal is also a tool I'll refer to over and over again. You're going to want it, trust me.

If you already have Signal, you can [contact me](#contact) via the Signal link on this very website. If we're not already acquainted, I'll ask you to verify that you are a sex worker through either a mutual (previously verified) friend of mine, or an age-verified Web presence. You need not give me your legal identity, just your working persona.

To start, tell me:

- what your concerns are, as succinctly but clearly as you can. Many people ask about:
    - identity correlation, risk of being doxxed, or how they can keep their civ life separate from their spicy personas
    - how to mitigate the risks of phishing emails or more reliably catch scams from people claiming to be clients,
    - using cryptocurrency, safer ways to handle receiving deposits, maintain financial independence, and avoid getting outed via payment systems,
    - improving the security of their booking process, screening process, or website booking forms generally,
    - and much more. You tell me what's keeping you up at night! If I can help, I'll let you know.
- when you can discuss the matter; I have a very flexible schedule, so it helps if you give me a couple different date/time options.
    - You can be as specific as you like; supplying a range is also okay.
- how long you want to reserve my time for. It's also okay not to know, in which case I'll make a suggestion based on your initial concerns.
    - Most people need at least 90 minutes for even basic concerns.
    - I'm likely to suggest a minimum of 2 hours. It's often the case that once we start tugging on one thread, we'll find it's connected to many others.
- where you can meet; the general neighborhood is specific enough. From there, we can find a caf√© that works for us both, or coordinate a more discreet venue if you need additional privacy.
    - I am also available for online consultations but this may dramatically limit some of what I can help with depending on your needs and initial concerns.
    - Refer to my travel [calendar](#tours) for my current best-guess of which city I'll be in on what dates.
- how much of a budget you have for this.
    - I am happy to accommodate sliding scale needs. Just let me know your situation and we'll take it from there.

The rest will be handled on Signal. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
