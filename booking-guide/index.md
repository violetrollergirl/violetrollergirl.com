# {{ site.title }}'s Booking Guide

Many people are attracted to trans women like me, but few get the chance to get intimate with us. One of my favorite things about being a trans provider is sharing in that moment of discovery with you, and relishing the joy, relief, and opening of possibility that comes with it.

To experience that, of course, you must first book me.

The booking process can feel daunting, especially if you're "new to all this," but **it really just boils down to being communicative.** The more information you give me about your situation, the more likely I will be able to align some stars for us.

## About this guide

I wrote this page to help those of you who want a meticulously crafted step-by-step guide to walk through booking time with me. It explains how to start and what to do at every step of the way. Its extraordinary detail may be overkill for many of you, but provides a thorough reference regardless.

The point of this is not not to ensure perfection, but rather to give you clarity during the process should you seek it. While this guide is specific to booking *me*, you'll probably find it useful for booking any companion, as most of what I ask for is standard across the industry.

## Who should read this page

This page is for:

- clients who already know they want to meet or speak with me privately.
- clients looking for absolute clarity on how to book me.

If you aren't yet sure whether I'm the girl for you, then you might want to have a look at the rest of my site before returning here. My [gallery]({% link index.html %}#gallery) shows you what I look like. (Yes, I really do look like that.) My ["tech specs" (about page)]({% link index.html %}#about) describe my vitals and my vibe. My [FAQ]({% link index.html %}#faq) has the answers to numerous questions about me and my offerings. My [rates page]({% link index.html %}#rates) provides a breakdown of considerations for my offerings. And my [tours and availability]({% link index.html %}#tours) page gives you details about where I'm traveling and when, along with some detail about how to bring me to your city for a special date. You can also learn about me from my prolific [social media posts and my softcore (and hardcore) content]({% link index.html %}#links-group-socials-amp-content).

And if you're still not sure? You can schedule [a brief introductory call]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-intro-call-and-deposit-20-minutes) with me, the cost of which can be directly applied to your deposit if you choose to book. For that, however, you'll need to schedule some time with me. This page can help you with that!

This page is *not* for:

- clients who are looking for information on how to research escorts generally.
- clients who need advice on general booking etiquette.
- clients who are looking for proof of my legitimacy or need help avoiding scams.
- clients who want assurance that I want to meet them. (The answer is always yes, [I absolutely do]({% link index.html %}#faq-is-it-okay-if-i-am-older-need-a-wheelchair-black-genderqueer-etc) want to meet you.)

If the above describes you, I recommend the following blog posts on the Tryst Blog instead of this page:

- [A First-time Client's Guide to Escort Booking Etiquette](https://tryst.link/blog/a-first-time-clients-guide-to-escort-booking-etiquette-tryst-sex-work-blog/){:target="_blank"}
- ['What if it's a scam?' How to have a successful date with a pro, by doing your homework.](https://tryst.link/blog/what-if-its-a-scam-find-escort/){:target="_blank"}

I also suggest spending a bit of time perusing the [Good Client Guide](https://goodclientguide.com/), a companion website that has compiled much of the same information.

## Start here: once you know you want to meet me

Everyone I meet begins at my [booking form]({% link index.html %}#contact). Additionally, my booking form offers some [rather novel privacy-preserving features]({% link colophon.md %}#privacy-guarantees-of-first-contact) that you may find valuable if you need extra levels of discretion, so it behooves you to use it.

To be clear:

- If you found me through [my ads or reviews on other sites]({% link index.html %}#links-group-ad-listings), I'm going to ask you to fill in my booking form.
- If we are already communicating some other way, I'm going to ask you to fill in my booking form when it comes time to schedule a specific date.
- If you're not sure whether we can meet at a given time or place, use my booking form to find out.
- If you don't know exactly when you want to meet, use my booking form to suggest some options.
- If you want to know when I'm available, I'll direct you to [my calendar]({% link index.html %}#tours) and then I'll ask you to fill in my booking form.
- If you're not sure whether or not I offer a service you want and need to speak with me about that, use my booking form to start the conversation about it.
- If all you want to do is have [a short introductory call]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-intro-call-and-deposit-20-minutes), use my booking form to schedule time for it with me.
- If you merely want to see me for a quick visit such as for a half hour appointment, I will still ask you to fill in my booking form.
- If you try to get my attention in any way in order to spend some time with you privately, but you didn't use my booking form to do it, I'll ask you to fill in my booking form.

At this point I hope it's clear that there is no way around using my booking form. Quite simply, my booking form is there to make the booking process easier and faster for both of us. It reduces the need for back-and-forth messages by making sure all the information I need to start setting up a meeting with you is present and available.

Filling out my booking form is a bare minimum show of good faith you must complete that proves you're as serious about meeting me as making the form in the first place proves to you that I'm excited to meet you.

### Fill in my mad-lib style booking form

In case it wasn't obvious yet, you have to fill in my booking form in order to spend time with me. :)

My booking form is styled as a mad lib game that you fill out. Remember [mad libs](https://madlibs.com/){:target="_blank"}? They are those fun little story templates that have blank spots asking you to choose parts of speech like adjectives or verbs. By the end, you create a cute story or poem or something. My booking form works the same way.

In place of a string of underscores, there's a form field, such as a text box or drop-down menu. Each field has a bit of placeholder text that explains what's expected there. For example, the first field is a text input box whose placeholder text reads, "Write your name here." So, if your name is Joe Smith, you would write, `Joe Smith` into that box.

When you fill in the field, it turns from red to neutral-toned, indicating that you've entered your information in a way I'll accept. Next, do the same with all the other fields.

Remember:

- If you don't know what to put into a field, it's okay to guess or be vague. The booking form is for *starting* your booking process, not ending it.
- If you aren't willing to provide some of the information my form asks for, then you aren't ready to meet. Wait until you are ready and willing to provide that information before continuing. It's okay to not be ready. I'll (probably?) wait for you, too.
- If you don't know where I'll be or where you'll be or when you want to meet, you need to at least make a best-effort guess to start the conversation with me. If you can't do that, you may just need to shore up your own itinerary before contacting me. I promise I'm more flexible than you and I want to make a meeting work out, but it takes two to tango.

For your reference, here is a detailed breakdown of what I expect in each and every field of the form.

#### Booking form field: your name

The first field in my booking form is a text box for your name.

* The field's label is:
    * My name is
* The field's placeholder reads: `Write your name here`
* You are expected to write your full name here. For example, `Joe Smith`.

You may not leave this field blank, because I need to know how to address you.

#### Booking form field: screening method

The second field of my booking form is a drop-down menu for choosing the method you would like to use for screening.

* The field's label is:
    * I read your [screening requirements]({% link index.html %}#screening-requirements) and am comfortable being screened by sending you
* The field's placeholder reads: `How you'll screen`
* You are expected to choose one from the following options:
    * Choose `my legal ID document` if you will send a selfie of yourself holding a driver's license or other government-issued photo ID document.
    * Choose `employment information` if you will send a link to your LinkedIn profile and are willing to verify your employment information via discreet email confirmation loop.
    * Choose `a deposit for a social date at a public venue` if you will send a deposit to confirm a reservation with me in person at a public venue for a platonic date, sometimes also called a "meet and greet."

You may not leave this field blank. If you have already screened with me, simply re-use the same value you chose earlier.

I very rarely require re-screening; it's required if you change numbers or contact me through a channel we've previously not used, so that I can re-verify your contact information and confirm that I'm speaking with the person I expect to be speaking with. You may also need to re-screen if it's been a very long time since our last correspondence (like a year or so).

For more information about screening, see my [FAQ: Why must I screen?/Screening makes me nervous.]({% link index.html %}#faq-why-must-i-screen-screening-makes-me-nervous).

#### Booking form field: phone number

The third field in my booking form is a text box for entering your carrier (non-burner) phone number. Every screening method requires this information.

* The field's label is:
    * My carrier phone number (for your screening purposes only) is
* The field's placeholder reads: `+1-555-123-4567`
* You are expected to enter the phone number associated with the phone you use with a major telecoms carrier.
    * I will *not* use this number to contact you unless you contact me from this number, first.
    * While you may contact me from any number you wish, the number you enter here must be a carrier number, not one from a burner or texting app.
    * To further clarify, this number should be associated with the name you entered in the "Your name" field.

You may not leave this field blank. I require it for each and every new friend who wants to book, regardless of which screening method you choose.

For more information about screening, see my [FAQ: How do I pass your screening process?]({% link index.html %}#faq-how-do-i-pass-your-screening-process).

#### Booking form field: preferred contact method

The fourth field in my booking form is a drop-down menu for you to choose how you'd like to contact me.

* The field's label is:
    * I prefer that we communicate using
* The field's placeholder reads: `Your preferred contact method`
* You are expected to choose one from the following options:
    * Choose `Signal Private Messenger` if you'd like the booking form to send your message to [my Signal Private Messenger account]({{ site.contact.signal.url }}){:target="_blank"}.
        * This is my preferred contact method, so you'll definitely earn some bonus points for messaging me this way!
        * You will need the Signal app installed on the device you are filling out the form from.
    * Choose `WhatsApp` if you'd like the booking form to send your message to my [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/){:target="_blank"} Business account.
        * You will need the WhatsApp app installed on the device you are filling out the form from.
    * Choose `email` if you'd like the booking form to send an email to my ProtonMail address ([`violetrollergirl@protonmail.com`](mailto:{{ site.contact.email }})).
        * You will need to have an email client or a webmail site installed on or registered with the device you are filling out the form from.
    * Choose `SMS/text message` if you'd like the booking form to send your message to my own plain text messaging number. You will need to have an SMS/text messaging app installed on the device you are filling out the form from.
        * You probably don't want to use this option if you are filling in my form from a laptop. (Consider email instead.)
        * Even from a phone, this option is not always reliable, and a warning to this effect will show up on the booking form when you select this option.

You may not leave this field blank, because I can't reply to you if you do.

This field also determines how I'll respond to your inquiry. For example, if you chose email, I'll reply from my email to the email address from which you messaged me. If you chose Signal, I'll reply via Signal to the Signal account from which you messaged me, etcetera.

#### Booking form field: source referral

The fifth field in my booking form is a text suggestion box for you to let me know how you first learned about me.

* The field's label is:
    * I found your Web site via
* The field's placeholder reads: `Where you found me`
* You are expected to write a brief description of where you first encountered me.
    * You can write anything you like, but in some Web browsers a list of suggestions will appear as you start typing.
    * You can choose one of these suggestions, or write some other free-form entry.

You may not leave this field blank, but what you enter here has no bearing on the rest of your inquiry and does not affect your booking in any way.

#### Booking form field: free-form notes

The sixth field in my booking form is a multi-line text area where you can write anything you like, including nothing at all, that gives me more information about why you think we'd have fun together.

* The field's label is:
    * I like your&hellip;
* The field's placeholder reads: `Photos? Vibe? Use a professional tone. Avoid vulgar language.`
* You are expected to write a brief description of why you want to see *me* and/or share any information about yourself that you think is relevant for our date.
    * You are encouraged to [express specific needs or desires in a respectful manner]({% link index.html %}#dos-and-donts-mention-needs-professionally).
    * If you are [booking as part of a couple or group]({% link index.html %}#dos-and-donts-speak-for-yourself), mention that here with enough detail for me to recognize which other half of the couple or members of the group you're referring to.
    * If you would like to book me and another provider together as a [duo]({% link index.html %}#friends), mention your interest in that here and name the other provider.

You may leave this field blank if you like, but this is your chance to make a unique first impression, so I encourage you to make the most of it.

#### Booking form field: booking type

The seventh field in my booking form is a drop down menu for you to choose the category of booking we'll need to coordinate.

* The field's label is:
    * May I reserve your time for
* The field's placeholder reads: `Choose booking type`
* You are expected to choose one from the following options:
    * Choose `an incall (provider hosts)` if you'd like to visit me at one of [my incall spaces]({% link index.html %}#incall-availability) or have me make [hotel arrangements]({% link index.html %}#hotel-arrangements) for us.
    * Choose `an outcall (client hosts)` if you'd like me to visit you at a hotel room, residence, or other venue you will arrange yourself.
    * Choose `a FMTY (travel with or to you)` if you'd like me to travel to a destination outside of my posted [tours]({% link index.html %}#tours) or home cities.
        * This is the option you want if you need to meet me in a place I don't normally go, or don't currently have any plans to visit.
    * Choose `a social date (platonic/screening only)` if you just want to meet for a vibe check, to test our compatibility in person, or if you want to screen by meeting in person.
        * This is not a free meeting; deposit and cancellation policies will apply as normal at my [social-only rate]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-social-only-date).
    * Choose `a virtual video date (online)` to reserve my time for a (possibly rather steamy) video call.
    * Choose `a texting/sexting session (online)` to reserve my time and attention for us to engage in some luxurious literary libations together.
    * Choose `an introductory call (phone)` to schedule [an introductory call]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-intro-call-and-deposit-20-minutes) at a time that's convenient for us both.

You may not leave this field blank. I need to know what you're hoping to book my time for so that we can plan accordingly.

#### Booking form field: service type

The eigth field in my booking form is a drop down menu for you to choose the service you're expecting of me during the booking.

* The field's label is:
    * for your
* The field's placeholder reads: `Choose service type`
* You are expected to choose one from the following options:
    * Choose `GFE/vanilla services` for almost all needs, including platonic, intimate companionship, and any other form of attention except specific fetishes.
    * Choose `pro-sub/BDSM services` to prepare me for entertaining specific kinks and fetishes, power play, or specialized roleplay scenarios.

You may not leave this field blank. It's okay if you're not sure which of these options to choose, we can talk about it at some detail once you complete screening.

#### Booking form field: duration

The ninth field in my booking form is a numeric input box for you to choose the length of time you'd like to spend with me.

* The field's label is:
    * for a duration of
* The field's placeholder reads: `#`
* You are expected to enter a number or decimal value, such as `1` for one hour, or `2.5` for two and a half hours.

You may not leave this field blank. If your Web browser supports it, you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to increase or decrease the number in steps of `0.5`, indicating a half hour (30 minutes). Note that I prioritize longer bookings with more notice over shorter appointments requested last minute.

#### Booking form field: location

The tenth field in my booking form is a text suggestion box for you to fill in the name of the place where you'd like to meet me. 

* The field's label is:
    * when I will be in
* The field's placeholder reads: `Anytown, USA (City, Country)`
* You are expected to enter the name of a city, a neighborhood, or just enter "`an online/remote location`" or something to that effect to indicate that the service you want can be fulfilled without physically meeting.
    * Cities that I service regularly will be available as suggestions in browsers that support this feature.
    * When I'm touring, you also may find those cities listed here, too.
    * Even if you don't see your city in this list, you can propose to meet anywhere you know you'll be and I'll try to align some stars for us.

You may not leave this field blank for bookings that require us to meet in person for what I hope are obvious reasons. I may ignore this field entirely if your inquiry is for a booking type that requests online, virtual, or remote services, but you still need to write *something* here, such as "online" to indicate this.

#### Booking form field: preferred date and time

The eleventh field in my booking form is a date and time entry widget for you to fill in a precise date and time that you most prefer to meet.

* The field's label is:
    * on
* The field's default value is a date and time in the past.
* You are expected to enter a date and time in the future.
    * You can enter any time you are available, but remember that planning our date in advance will give us the best experience together.
    * The more notice you give me, the more time we have to build anticipation and set up a lovely time together.
    * Especially [short notice bookings]({% link index.html %}#short-notice-availability) (less than 24 hours) may incur a rush fee.

You may not leave this field blank because all bookings must be performed at *some* time, and I need to know when you're availale to spend that time with me.

#### Booking form field: alternate date and time

The twelfth field in my booking form is a date and time entry widget for you to fill in a precise date and time that you can also meet if your first choice is not one we can make work together.

* The field's label is:
    * or, alternatively, on
* The field's default value is a date and time in the past.
* You are expected to enter a date and time in the future.
    * You can enter any time you are available, but remember that planning our date in advance will give us the best experience together.
    * You probably shouldn't enter the same date and time as the first one, because that defeats the point of providing alternatives.
    * The more notice you give me, the more time we have to build anticipation and set up a lovely time together.
    * Especially [short notice bookings]({% link index.html %}#short-notice-availability) (less than 24 hours) may incur a rush fee.

You may not leave this field blank because all bookings must be performed at *some* time, and I need to know when you're availale to spend that time with me. By providing an alternative option as a backup to the first option, you help reduce the amount of back-and-forth we need to schedule something in case the first time doesn't work.

#### Booking form field: confirm policy agreement

The thirteenth field in my booking form is a checkbox that you must check to confirm that you have read and agree to my published [policies]({% link index.html %}#policies).

* The field's label is:
    * Yes, I have read, understood, and fully agree to abide by the information on your Web site, including your [rates]({% link index.html %}#rates), [policies]({% link index.html %}#policies), and [availability]({% link index.html %}#tours).
* The field's default value is *unchecked*.
* You are expected to check the box.

You must check this box to submit my booking form and continue to the next step. By checking this box, you acknowledge that you have read and understood and fully agree to abide by the information stated on my website. I know there's a lot of information on my site. Yes, I do expect you to read all of it before booking me.

#### Booking form field: confirm screening attachment

The fourteenth field in my booking form is a checkbox that you must check to confirm that you agree to send screening information if you have elected to use a remote screening option.

* The field's label is:
    * Yes, I will attach all relevant screening information. I understand that incomplete inquiries, such as those without screening information, may not receive a reply.
* The field's default value is *unchecked*.
* You are expected to check the box.

You must check this box to submit my booking form and continue to the next step. By checking this box, you acknowledge that you will go through my lightweight screening process. Note that nowhere did you actually provide the screening information yet. This means if you do not provide the screening information in the next step, your inquiry will likely not receive a reply.

## Submit my booking form to send your inquiry

Once you think you've completed filling in all the fields in the form, you can press the buttons at the bottom to submit it. There are two buttons, numbered 1 and 2.

1. Click or tap the first button, which reads "`Copy inquiry to clipboard`". The text of the button will change to "`Copied! (Click to copy again.)`"
    * Pressing this button reads your entries in my booking form and places a copy of its text in your device's clipboard.
1. If the second button reads "`Check form fields`," it means you omitted a required field, or entered information I won't accept, such as a date or time in the past. Otherwise, the button will read "`Send inquiry`." Click or tap this second button to continue.
    * If the button still said "`Check form fields`" when you pressed it, you'll be refocused on the first form field whose value needs correction.
    * If the button read, "`Send inquiry`," pressing it will progress you to the next step.

When you press the `Send inquiry` button, your chosen communication method (email, Signal, WhatsApp, etcetera) will activate. Your browser might also show you a dialogue box informing you that another app will open to handle this action, so click **Ok** to open that other app.

### Review and confirm your inquiry is as you desire

After you fill all the fields in my booking form and press the `Send inquiry` button on my booking form, the corresponding app for the contact method you chose earlier will open directly to a conversation thead or draft message with all the information you entered in my booking form written out for you. The exception to this is if you chose Signal Private Messenger. In this case, use the clip/pasteboard feature (such as by pressing Control-V on your keyboard), to paste the form's message into the Signal conversation that was opened with me.

Now's a good time to review your inquiry to me before you commit to sending it. My booking form composed what I consider [an *ideal initial inquiry*]({% link index.html %}#contact-instructions) for you. (In fact, if you ask around, I'm sure many other providers will largely agree that they'd find it hot to get a first message written like this, too!) Make sure it says what you want, and that you entered the information you intended to.

Since the message you're about to send is just text, you can also extend any part of the inquiry by simply editing the drafted message at this point. Please feel free to get as creative as you like, but keep the tone professional and don't start asking highly explicit questions or using overtly sexualized language. Save that for after you screen.

### Attach your screening information to the templated message

The only thing missing from your message now is your screening information, which you'll need to send me if you've never screened with me before and are inquiring about anything other than a social meet-and-greet.

[My booking form is designed to  carefully protect your privacy at this early stage]({% link colophon.md %}#privacy-guarantees-of-first-contact), which is why you're expected to directly attach it to this pre-written message rather than via the Web form. Regardless of which app you're now using to contact me (Signal, WhatsApp, email, or txt message), you have the option of attaching or sending images to screen yourself with:

* If you chose Signal Private Messenger, [tap or click the plus (`+`) icon or the paperclip icon to attach a photo](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007060212-Send-a-message#:~:text=to%20attach%20a%20photo){:target="_blank"}.
* If you chose WhatsApp, [follow these instructions to attach a photo](https://faq.whatsapp.com/453914586839706/){:target="_blank"}.
* If you chose email, use your email's built-in attachment feature as usual.
* If you chose SMS/text message, you can also use your messenger's built-in attachment feature just like normal.

Make sure the screening photo you attach is clear, recent, and is high-quality enough to be read clearly. Sometimes, SMS/text messages downgrade the quality of photos, so be prepared to re-send it if I ask you to, possibly through a different communication channel. Once again, Signal Private Messenger is the most private and most reliable communiation mechanism. Please consider using it if you aren't already.

### Send your inquiry via your chosen app

Once you have attached your screening information to the pre-drafted message, **Send** the message!

Voila! You've sent your inquiry. Take a break from the screen, put your phone down, enjoy a walk, go to the gym, or just enjoy the building anticipation of knowing that I'm going to squee with pleasure when I see it!

### Patiently wait for my reply

Please be patient awaiting my reply. Under normal circumstances, it can take me up to a day or two to reply to even the most tempting inquiries. If I'm currently traveling, it can take even longer. I can promise you that well-crafted inquiries, such as those composed by my booking form, are all but guanrateed to receive an excited reply in short order!

At this point, we're in contact, and the goal is simply to work out any remaining details.

My reply will:

* reiterate my understanding of your expectations and desires, so that we're both on the same page. 
* propose that we act on one of the two date and time options you initially suggested.
* maybe ask for follow-up information, such as any further screening information or logisitcal details, if necessary.
* probably contain a lot of happy words and a fair number of heart emojis.

#### If you don't receive a reply

If you don't receive a reply from me, it can be because of any of the following reasons:

* You omitted screening information.
* You requested a session on very short notice, or for the same day.
    * While I can sometimes accomodate a same-day appointment, this is rare and I may not reply if I can't.
    * You are still expected to screen, even for same-day requests.
* You used sexually explicit language somewhere in your inquiry.
* Your email was filtered to my spam folder. I do check my spam folder, but I maintain an extremely strict spam filter that will flag your message if:
    * your email address looks like a bot's.
    * your email was recently created.
    * your email was sent from an anonymous mailing service.
    * you attached a file type other than a single-frame image (JPEG, PNG, or non-animated WEBP). Any email with other types of attachments will get deleted instantly. (Attaching [OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/){:target="_blank"} keys is also acceptable.)
* You used txt/SMS, especially from a burner, texting app, or VoIP number.
    * It's okay to communicate with me from these apps, but they are extremely unreliable and I may not have received it.
    * Consider just using [Signal Private Messenger](https://signal.org/){:target="_blank"} on your burner phone, insead.

### Confirm date details by sending a deposit

When you receive my reply, read it closely!

In the simplest case, I'll confirm my understanding of your expectations, pick one of the two date and time options you suggested in your initial inquiry, and supply you with instructions for how to send your deposit for our session. Sending your deposit is what holds your appointment in my calendar, so send it promptly to reserve our time together.

For more information, see my [deposit policy]({% link index.html %}#deposit-policy).

#### About extensive or synchronous correspondence

It rarely takes more than three to five messages to inquire, confirm, and realize a date.

1. Message one: you send your complete inquiry with screening information.
1. Message two: I reply with a confirmation of your expectations, date details including the chosen date/time from your suggested options, and instructions for sending your deposit.
1. Message three: you confirm these details and send your deposit to reserve time in my calendar.

Real life is often messier, and it's possible that I'll need to ask you about, say, food allergies or preferences if we're going out, or clarify something in your inquiry. There is no strict limit to how many messages we'll exchange, but you'll undoubtedly notice my attention to detail and thoroughness in each and every one that I send. My goal is to handle logistics quickly so that we can get on to the really fun stuff equally quickly!

If we find ourselves unable to plan for and set a specific date, time, or place for your appointment in more than five back-and-forth messages, it may mean you aren't quite ready to book, and I'll probably suggest you send a new inquiry when you are. It's no big deal, I just need to move on to other inquiries.

Otherwise, if you feel like you need more correspondence or a real-time conversatiop to iron out logistics or communicate and set expectations, you can:

* schedule [an introductory call]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-intro-call-and-deposit-20-minutes) so we can get on the phone and talk things out or settle any pre-date nerves.
* demonstrate good etiquette by [sending me a tip]({% link index.html %}#links-group-tip-me) or buying me a gift off [my wishlist]({% link index.html %}#links-throne) as a show of good faith recognition for the additional planning time.

## Enjoy the building anticipation of our upcoming date

Anticipation is an often overlooked part of foreplay, so this is frequently more fun than you may at first think! Once we've worked out the details, you can simply enjoy the building anticipation of our time together.

### The day before our date

On the day before our date, I'll send you a reminder message. The reminder will re-confirm all the details we've already worked out (date, time, duration, and so on).

In this reminder message, I'll also provide more specific instructions for exactly how to meet, including things like where to park if you're driving, which intersection to meet at, a specific address with instructions on how to use the buzzer, and so on.

If you haven't met a companion before, this part can feel a bit like spycraft, but don't worry. That's just pre-date jitters and butterflies. Once we see one another, everything will start to feel much more comfortable!

### If you need to reschedule or cancel

As the time for our date comes closer, it's important that you stay in touch with me if plans need to change. Rescheduling is perfectly acceptable, and normal, but you need to communicate this to me so we can make other arrangements without stressing.

For more information, see my [cancellation policy]({% link index.html %}#cancellation-policy).

## Show up

This step is the most fun: show up, and let me take care of the rest. ;)
