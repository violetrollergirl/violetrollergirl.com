# Booking Guide

Many people are attracted to trans women like me, but few get the chance to get intimate with one of us. One of my favorite things about being a trans provider is sharing in that moment of discovery with you, and relishing the joy, relief, and opening of possibility that comes with it. To experience that, of dourse, you must first book me.

The booking process can feel daunting, especially if you are "new to all this." I wrote this page to help those of you who want a meticulously crafted step-by-step guide to complete your booking with me. It explains how to start and what to do at every step of the way, in extraordinary detail.

The point here is not perfection, but rather more clarity. While this guide is specific to booking *me*, you might find it useful for booking any escort.

## Who should read this page

This page is for:

- clients who already know they want to meet me.
- clients looking for absolute clarity on how to book me.

If you aren't yet sure whether I'm the girl for you, then you might want to have a look at the rest of my site. My [gallery]({% link index.html %}#gallery) shows you what I look like. My ["tech specs" (about page)]({% link index.html %}#about) describe my vitals and my vibe. My [FAQ]({% link index.html %}#faq) has the answers to numerous questions about me and my offerings. My [rates page]({% link index.html %}#rates) provides a breakdown of considerations for my offerings. And my [tours and availability]({% link index.html %}#tours) page gives you details about where I'm traveling and when, along with some detail about how to bring me to your city for a special date. You can also learn about me from my prolific [social media posts and my softcore (and hardcore) content]({% link index.html %}#links-group-socials-amp-content).

Still not sure? You can also schedule [a brief introductory call]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-intro-call-and-deposit-20-minutes) with me, the cost of which can be directly applied to your deposit if you choose to book!

This page is *not* for:

- clients who are looking for information on how to research escorts generally.
- clients who need advice on general booking etiquette.
- clients who are looking for proof of my legitimacy or need help avoiding scams.
- clients who want assurance that I want to meet them. (The answer is always yes, [I absolutely do]({% link index.html %}#faq-is-it-okay-if-i-am-older-need-a-wheelchair-black-genderqueer-etc) want to meet you.)

If the above describes you, I recommend the following blog posts on the Tryst Blog instead of this page:

- [A First-time Client's Guide to Escort Booking Etiquette](https://tryst.link/blog/a-first-time-clients-guide-to-escort-booking-etiquette-tryst-sex-work-blog/)
- ['What if it's a scam?' How to have a successful date with a pro, by doing your homework.](https://tryst.link/blog/what-if-its-a-scam-find-escort/)

I also suggest spending a bit of time perusing the [Good Client Guide](https://goodclientguide.com/), a companion website that has compiled much of the same information.
