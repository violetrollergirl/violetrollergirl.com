# Booking Guide

Many people are attracted to trans women like me, but few get the chance to get intimate with one of us. One of my favorite things about being a trans provider is sharing in that moment of discovery with you, and relishing the joy, relief, and opening of possibility that comes with it. To experience that, of dourse, you must first book me.

The booking process can feel daunting, especially if you are "new to all this." I wrote this page to help those of you who want a meticulously crafted step-by-step guide to complete your booking with me. It explains how to start and what to do at every step of the way, in extraordinary detail.

The point here is not perfection, but rather more clarity. While this guide is specific to booking *me*, you might find it useful for booking any escort.

## Who should read this page

This page is for:

- clients who already know they want to meet me.
- clients looking for absolute clarity on how to book me.

If you aren't yet sure whether I'm the girl for you, then you might want to have a look at the rest of my site. My [gallery]({% link index.html %}#gallery) shows you what I look like. My ["tech specs" (about page)]({% link index.html %}#about) describe my vitals and my vibe. My [FAQ]({% link index.html %}#faq) has the answers to numerous questions about me and my offerings. My [rates page]({% link index.html %}#rates) provides a breakdown of considerations for my offerings. And my [tours and availability]({% link index.html %}#tours) page gives you details about where I'm traveling and when, along with some detail about how to bring me to your city for a special date. You can also learn about me from my prolific [social media posts and my softcore (and hardcore) content]({% link index.html %}#links-group-socials-amp-content).

Still not sure? You can also schedule [a brief introductory call]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-intro-call-and-deposit-20-minutes) with me, the cost of which can be directly applied to your deposit if you choose to book!

This page is *not* for:

- clients who are looking for information on how to research escorts generally.
- clients who need advice on general booking etiquette.
- clients who are looking for proof of my legitimacy or need help avoiding scams.
- clients who want assurance that I want to meet them. (The answer is always yes, [I absolutely do]({% link index.html %}#faq-is-it-okay-if-i-am-older-need-a-wheelchair-black-genderqueer-etc) want to meet you.)

If the above describes you, I recommend the following blog posts on the Tryst Blog instead of this page:

- [A First-time Client's Guide to Escort Booking Etiquette](https://tryst.link/blog/a-first-time-clients-guide-to-escort-booking-etiquette-tryst-sex-work-blog/)
- ['What if it's a scam?' How to have a successful date with a pro, by doing your homework.](https://tryst.link/blog/what-if-its-a-scam-find-escort/)

I also suggest spending a bit of time perusing the [Good Client Guide](https://goodclientguide.com/), a companion website that has compiled much of the same information.

## Start here: once you know you want to meet

Everyone I meet begins at my [booking form]({% link index.html %}#contact). Additionally, my booking form offers some [rather novel privacy-preserving features]({% link colophon.md %}#privacy-gaurantees-of-first-contact) that you may find valuable if you need extra levels of discretion, so it behooves you to use it.

To be clear:

- Even if you found me through [my ads or reviews on other sites]({% link index.html %}#links-group-ad-listings), I'm going to ask you to fill in my booking form.
- I'm going to ask you to fill in my booking form even if we are already communicating some other way.
- If you're not sure whether we can meet at a given time or place, use my booking form to find out.
- If you don't know exactly when you want to meet, use my booking form to make a guess. If you ask me when I'm available, I'll direct you to [my calendar]({% link index.html %}#tours) and then I'll ask when you are and ask you to write it in my booking form. So just propose a time that you expect will work *for you* so we can start working together to make it happen.
- If you're not sure whether or not I offer a service you want and need to speak with me about that, use my booking form to start the conversation.
- If all you want to do is have [a short introductory call]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-intro-call-and-deposit-20-minutes), use my booking form to schedule time for it with me.
- If you merely want to see me for a quick visit such as for a half hour appointment, I will still ask you to fill in my booking form.

If you don't use my booking form, I'll ask you to fill in my booking form. There is no way around this. The form is there to make the booking process easier and faster for both of us. It reduces back-and-forth exchanges and makes sure all the information I need to make meeting with you possible is present and available.

Filling out the form is a bare minimum show of good faith that proves you're as serious about meeting me as making the form in the first place proves to you that I'm excited to meet you.

### Fill in my mad-lib style booking form

In case it wasn't obvious yet, you have to fill in my booking form before you meet with me. :)

My booking form is styled as a mad lib game that you fill out. Remember [mad libs](https://madlibs.com/){:target="_blank"}? They were those fun little story templates that had blank spots asking you choose parts of speech like adjectives or verbs. By the end, you created a cute story or poem or something. My form works the same way.

In place of a string of underscores, there's a form field, such as a text box or drop-down menu. Each field has a bit of placeholder text that explains what's expected there. For example, the first field is a text input box whose placeholder text reads, "Write your name here." So, if your name is Joe Smith, you would write, `Joe Smith` into that box.

When you fill in the field, it turns from red to neutral-toned, indicating that you've entered your information in a way I'll accept. Next, do the same with all the other fields.

Remember:

- If you don't know what to put into a field, it's okay to guess or be vague. The form is for *starting* the booking process, not ending it.
- If you aren't willing to provide some of the information my form asks for, you aren't ready to meet, and you should wait until you are ready and willing to provide that information before continuing. It's okay, I'll wait, too.
- If you don't know where I'll be or where you'll be or when you want to meet, you need to at least make a best-effort guess to start the conversation with me. If you can't do that, you may just need to shore up your own itinerary before contacting me. I promise I'm more flexible than you and I want to make a meeting work out, but it takes two to tango.

For your refenrece, here is a detailed breakdown of what I expect in each and every field of the form.

#### Booking form field: your name

The first field in my booking form is a text box for your name.

* The field's label is:
    * My name is
* The field's placeholder reads: `Write your name here`
* You are expected to write your full name here. For example, `Joe Smith`.

#### Booking form field: screening method

The second field of my booking form is a drop-down menu for choosing the method you would like to use for screening.

* The field's label is:
    * I read your [screening requirements]({% link index.html %}#screening-requirements) and am comfortable being screened by sending you
* The field's placeholder reads: `How you'll screen`
* You are expected to choose one from the following options:
    * Choose `my legal ID document` if you will send a selfie of yourself holding a driver's license or other government-issued photo ID document.
    * Choose `employment information` if you will send a link to your LinkedIn profile and are willing to verify your employment information via discreet email confirmation loop.
    * Choose `a deposit for a social date at a public venue` if you will send a deposit to confirm a reservation with me in person at a public venue for a platonic date, sometimes also called a "meet and greet."

You may not leave this field blank. If you have already screened with me, simply re-use the same value you chose earlier. I very rarely require re-screening; it's required if you change numbers or contact me through a channel we've previously not used, so that I can re-verify your contact information and confirm that I'm speaking with the person I think I am speaking with. You may also need to re-screen if it's been a very long time since our last correspondence (like a year or so).

For more information about screening, see my [FAQ: Why must I screen?/Screening makes me nervous.]({% link index.html %}#faq-why-must-i-screen-screening-makes-me-nervous).

#### Booking form field: phone number

The third field in my booking form is a text box for entering your carrier (non-burner) phone number. Every screening method requires this information.

* The field's label is:
    * My carrier phone number (for your screening purposes only) is
* The field's placeholder reads: `+1-555-123-4567`
* You are expected to enter the phone number of your primary phone number.

I will *not* use this number to contact you unless you contact me from this number, first. You may contact me from any number you wish, but this number must be a non-burner, carrier-provided phone number associated with the name you entered in the "Your name" field. I use this number for safety screening and verification purposes only, unless you initiate contact with me through this number first.

You may not leave this field blank. I require it for each and every new friend, regardless of which screening method you choose.

For more information about screning, see my [FAQ: How do I pass your screening process?]({% link index.html %}#faq-how-do-i-pass-your-screening-process).

#### Booking form field: preferred contact method

The fourth field in my booking form is a drop-down menu for you to choose how you'd like to contact me.

* The field's label is:
    * I prefer that we communicate using
* The field's placeholder reads: `Your preferred contact method`
* You are expected to choose one from the following options:
    * Choose `Signal Private Messenger` if you'd like the booking form to send me your message to my [Signal Private Messenger](https://Signal.org/){:target="_blank"} account. This is my preferred contact method so you will definitely earn some bonus points for messaging me this way! You will need the Signal app installed on the device you are filling out the form from.
    * Choose `WhatsApp` if you'd like the booking form to send me your message to my [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/){:target="_blank"} Business account. You will need the WhatsApp app installed on the device you are filling out the form from.
    * Choose `email` if you'd like the booking form to send me an email to my ProtonMail address ([`violetrollergirl@protonmail.com`]({% include mailto-booking.url %})). You will need to have an email client or a webmail account installed on the device you are filling out the form from.
    * Choose `SMS/text message` if you'd like the booking form to send me your message to my own plain text messaging number. You will need to have an SMS/text messaging app installed on the device you are filling out the form from.
    * You probably don't want to use this option if you are using a laptop.
    * Even from a phone, this option is not always reliable, and a warning to this effect will show up on the booking form when you select this option.

You may not leave this field blank, because I can't reply to you if you do.

This field also determines how I'll respond to your inquiry. For example, if you chose email, I'll reply to your email from the email address you messaged me. If you chose Signal, I'll reply via Signal to the Signal account from which you messaged me, etcetera.

#### Booking form field: source referral

The fifth field in my booking form is a text suggestion box for you to let me know how you first learned about me.

* The field's label is:
    * I found your Web site via
* The field's placeholder reads: `Where you found me`
* You are expected to write a brief description of where you first encountered me.
    * You can write anything you like, but in some Web browsers a list of suggestions will appear as you start typing.
    * You can choose one of these suggestions, or write some other free-form entry.

You may not leave this field blank, but what you enter here has no bearing on the rest of your inquiry and does not affect your booking in any way.

#### Booking form field: free-form notes

The sixth field in my booking form is a multi-line text area where you can write anything you like, including nothing at all, that gives me more information about why you think we'd have fun together.

* The field's label is:
    * I like your&hellip;
* The field's placeholder reads: `Photos? Vibe? Use a professional tone. Avoid vulgar language.`
* You are expected to write a brief description of why you want to see *me* and/or share any information about yourself that you think is relevant for our date.
    * You are encouraged to express specific needs or desires in a respectful manner.

You may leave this field blank if you like, but this is your chance to make a unique first impression, so I encourage you to make the most of it.

#### Booking form field: booking type

The seventh field in my booking form is a drop down menu for you to choose the category of booking we'll need to coordinate.

* The field's label is:
    * May I reserve your time for
* The field's placeholder reads: `Choose booking type`
* You are expected to choose one from the following options:
    * Choose `an incall (provider hosts)` if you'd like to visit me at one of [my incall spaces]({% link index.html %}#incall-availability) or have me make [hotel arrangements]({% link index.html %}#hotel-arrangements) for us.
    * Choose `an outcall (client hosts)` if you'd like me to visit you at a hotel room, residence, or other venue you will arrange yourself.
    * Choose `a FMTY (travel with or to you)` if you'd like me to travel to a destination of my posted [tours]({% link index.html %}#tours). This is the option you want if you need to meet me in a place I don't normally go, or have any plans to visit.
    * Choose `a social date (platonic/screening only)` if you just want to meet for a vibe check, to test our compatibility in person, or if you want to screen by meeting in person. Deposit and cancellation policies will apply as normal at my [social-only rate]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-social-only-date).
    * Choose `a virtual video date (online)` to reserve my time for a (possibly rather steamy) video call.
    * Choose `a texting/sexting session (online)` to reserve my time and attention for us to engage in some luxurious literary libations together.
    * Choose `an introductory call (phone)` to schedule [an introductory call]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-intro-call-and-deposit-20-minutes) at a time that's convenient for us both.

You may not leave this field blank. I need to know what you're hoping to book my time for so that we can plan accordingly.

#### Booking form field: service type

The eight field in my booking form is a drop down menu for you to choose the service you're expecting of me during the booking.

* The field's label is:
    * for your
* The field's placeholder reads: `Choose service type`
* You are expected to choose one from the following options:
    * Choose `GFE/vanilla services` for almost all needs, including platonic, intimate companionship, and any other form of attention except specific fetishes.
    * Choose `pro-sub/BDSM services` to prepare me for entertaining specific kinks and fetishes, power play, or specialized roleplay scenarios.

You may not leave this field blank. It's okay if you're not sure which of these options to choose, we can talk about it at some detail once you complete screening.

#### Booking form field: duration

The ninth field in my booking form is a numeric input box for you to choose the length of time you'd like to spend with me.

* The field's label is:
    * for a duration of
* The field's placeholder reads: `#`
* You are expected to enter a number or decimal value, such as `1` for one hour, or `2.5` for two and a half hours.

You may not leave this field blank. If your Web browser supports it, you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to increase or decrease the number in steps of `0.5`, indicating a half hour (30 minutes). Note that I prioritize longer bookings.

#### Booking form field: location

The tenth field in my booking form is a text suggestion box for you to fill in the name of the place where you'd like to meet me. 

* The field's label is:
    * when I will be in
* The field's placeholder reads: `Anytown, USA (City, Country)`
* You are expected to enter the name of a city, a neighborhood, or just enter "`an online/remote location`" or something to that effect to indicate that the service you want can be fulfilled without physically meeting.

You may not leave this field blank. If you aren't sure where you'll be at a given date or time, consider shoring up your itinerary before reaching out to me.

#### Booking form field: alternate date and time
