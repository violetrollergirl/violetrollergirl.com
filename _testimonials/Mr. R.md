After having first lurked on Violet's socials for a while, I knew I wanted to take her on a date if I was ever able to. Luckily enough, I saw her coming close to my city and took the opportunity to book a night for us to get dinner and go to a barcade.

I was a little nervous on the way down, but this disappeared right away beacuse Violet was incredibly friendly and full of energy and life. She is just as brilliant in every way in person as on her socials. Plus, she loves arcades like I do which was a real treat! Between the ease of having great conversations, her teasing flirtations over the games, and her delighted enthusiasm back at our room, the night quickly melted away as we went from games to cuddling and more.

That first night I spent with Violet is one of the most fun I've had, only to be matched by the next times I'd see her. Violet is always such an engaging and wonderful lover. I keep looking forward to the time I get to spend with her and I'm *so* glad I pounced on the opportunity to meet her when I did!
