Even before our date, we had quickly developed a fun and natural connection over text. Even so, I booked a few hours and brought some takeout for us so we could ease into it if need be, hoping we'd have even half the chemistry in person as we had in 2D.

Well. Thinking back, I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that all questions evaporated immediately when I arrived. Before I knew it, I found myself in a deep embrace where I could feel both of our hearts racing. It was simultaneously like a reunion with a long-time lover and also full of the electricity of something new. We quickly forgot about the takeout and the rest is kind of a blur.

We had great conversations, some serious but plenty also laced with Vi's deliciously flirty and dirty way with words. There were relaxing breaks for cuddling, eating, and massaging. And of course many other fun activities! (Let's just say that Vi takes care of her body and knows how to use it with enthusiasm and creativity.)

Throughout it all, Vi was present, attentive, and engaging and made it clear in so many ways that she was having as much fun as I was. It was such a great time with such a great woman and I'm very much looking forward to seeing her again.
