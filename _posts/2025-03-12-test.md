This is the body of the (test) post. It can contain any long-form text that makes sense in the context of an article, including images, lists, and more.

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

It may also contain ordered lists:

1. Numbered item 1
1. Numbered item 2
1. Numbered item 3

Images are going to look like this:

![]({% link images/gallery-originals/pool-queen.jpg %})

Text can be formatted. For example, *italicized text looks like this*, whereas **bolded text looks like this**.
