    Brilliant, bubbly, and beautifully nerdy, I don't wait to be entertained; I'll start the conversation, make you laugh, and invite you into the moment with grace and without pressure.

    It's okay if I'm your "first" because, don't worry, you wouldn't be mine! ;)

    I'm fit, freckled, confident, kind, and unapologetically curious about everything, especially you. Make me yearn for you by being as uninhibited and free-spirited in my presence as I am in yours!

    Is it obvious? Good sci-fi (both Star Trek and Star Warsâ€”I'm not religious!), cyberpunk retro tech, classic techno beats, and vintage video games are some of my happy places.

    Craving sweetness? My skin's softer than silk. Want to explore your dominant side? I get kinkier than my curls.

    If you're the type who thinks as much as they feel, who laughs before they lean in, who appreciates genuine connection over pretense? Come meet me, Brooklyn's Power Princes.
