headline: Brooklyn's own power princess, not pillow princess
description: |
  I don't wait to be entertained; I'll start the conversation, make you laugh, and pull you into the moment. I love connection, the kind where you feel seen and heard—and deeply. The sort of genuine coupling where our affection lingers in your mind long after we say goodnight.

  I'm bubbly, witty, confident, kind, but most importantly I'm unapologetically curious about everything, especially you. Make me smile and yearn for you by being as uninhibited and free-spirited in my presence as I am in yours!

  Maybe you've already guessed: good science fiction (Star Trek and Star Wars—I'm not religious!), cyberpunk retro tech, a classic techno beat, and a good vintage video game are some of my happy places.

  I'm fit, freckled, and fascinated by the way technology, touch, and emotion intersect. I have skin softer than silk, and a mind sharper than a diamond's edge.

  If you're the type who thinks as much as you feel, who laughs before they lean in? Maybe it's time you met Brooklyn's Power Princess.
