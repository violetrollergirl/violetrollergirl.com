about: |
  If you’re curious, yes, I live on my rollerblades…but I do know when to take them off. ;)

  I don’t wait to be entertained; I’ll start the conversation, make you laugh, and pull you into the moment. I love connection, the kind where you feel seen and heard. The sort of genuine coupling where our affection lingers in your mind long after we say goodnight.

  I’m obsessed with projects that keep my brain moving as fast as my wheels. My current fixation? Navigating cryptocurrency price charts and blockchain technology rabbit holes. Nerdy? Perhaps. But decoding patterns and puzzles fuels my passion for constant engagement.

  Maybe you’ve already guessed: good science fiction (Star Trek and Star Wars—I’m not religious!), cyberpunk retro tech, a classic techno beat, and a good vintage video game are some of my happy places. Join me for a game? Or, if you’d rather watch, catch me bending over a pool table as I run the game in my skirt (and my skates).

  I’m bubbly, witty, confident, kind, but most importantly I’m unapologetically curious about everything, especially you. Make me smile for you by being as free-spirited in my presence as I am in yours!

  For me, closeness is an experiment in trust, timing, and tension; every shared look, touch felt, and word spoken, a deliberate choice. Our connection will be choreography, not chaos. We’ll dance in a space between confidence and curiosity, safety and risk.

  I’m not new to power exchange. I’ve studied it, lived it, and brought it to life in clubs from Brooklyn to Berlin; with trusted partners, I get kinkier than my curls. Years in leather and BDSM circles taught me that control and surrender are a language, one I’m fluent in.

  I’m fit, freckled, and fascinated by the way technology, touch, and emotion intersect. I have skin softer than silk, and a mind sharper than a diamond knife.

  If you’re the type who thinks as much as you feel, who laughs before they lean in? Maybe it’s time you met Brooklyn’s Power Princess.
