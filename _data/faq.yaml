- title: How do I pass your screening process?
  body: |
    My screening process is the same as many other providers&rsquo; and is required for our mutual safety and comfort. The [Contact](#contact) page on this site describes your screening options. To summarize that page and your options for screening, they are:

    1. Attach a selfie plus a LinkedIn profile link plus a real phone number (not a number from a texting app) to your next message to me.
    2. Attach a selfie of yourself holding a valid government-issued photo ID to your next message to me.
    3. [Book me](#contact) for a platonic, meet-and-greet/social-only date. My usual deposit and cancellation policies apply.

    Screening is mandatory. If you are not ready to be screened, please wait until you are before contacting me.

    Hmm, well, that's for me to know, and for you to [book me](#contact) and bend me over to find out. ;)
