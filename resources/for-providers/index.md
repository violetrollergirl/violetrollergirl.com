# {{ site.title}}'s Resources for Providers

This page lists resources I've created to help providers.

## [Using cryptocurrency]({% link resources/for-providers/using-cryptocurrency/index.md %})

Cryptocurrency gets a bad rap and, in many situations, it's deserved. Most of the "crypto" sector is just not relevant, not helpful, and not intended for us as sex workers. However, there is a sliver of really powerful stuff in there, and I want to normalize that slice of it because I truly believe that doing so is vital to protecting ourselves, our clients, and our financial futures.

I hope these short, stand alone articles help you better understand why there are real benefits to using the good parts of what cryptocurrency makes possible, what those benefits are, and how to capitalize on them in your day-to-day dealings as a sex worker.

## [Using Signal for Sex Work]({% link resources/for-providers/signal-for-sex-work/index.md %})

Communicating discreetly is tantamount to communicating freely. For sex workers, having this capability makes the difference between a viable income or not. While there are innumerable messaging applications out there, Signal Private Messenger has emerged as the clear winner for my needs in terms of balancing client adoption, communications security, and ease of use.

Simply using Signal over any other messenger massively improves the safety of your correspondence, but there are some additional privacy features and advanced settings sex workers who are using Signal for work should take a look at. In this guide, I'll explain them all.

## [{{ site.title }}'s Website Colophon]({% link colophon/index.md %})

I'm pretty proud of my Web site. Sometimes, other providers ask me how I made this site. Some clients have, too.

There are some novel things about it that I'd like to highlight, like my unique mad-lib style [booking form](#contact), [cryptocurrency payment links]({% link index.html %}#links-group-tip-me), and deep-linkable anchors.

So here's a bit of technical information regarding how it all works.
