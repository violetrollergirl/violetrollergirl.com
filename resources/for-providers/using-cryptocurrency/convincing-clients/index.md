Hopefully by now you've seen how quickly you can get set up with privacy coins like Zcash using private-by-default wallet apps like Zashi. Over time, you'll surely find more and more opportunities to use this private economic technology with one another. But I especially hope you'll start to convince clients and customers to use it, too.

I know that's not necessarily going to be easy. But it is going to be important. Privacy is very famously a "network problem," meaning our privacy is only as safe as the person least willing to protect it on our behalf. While there are absolutely things we can do to protect ourselves, at the end of the day, we are all safer if everyone participates in this private-by-default economy as often as possible.
