# Start using cryptocurrency today, as a sex worker

If you, like me, participate in any part of the economy that risks your ability to participate in traditional banking systems&mdash;even legal sex work like modeling on OnlyFans can get your bank account flagged&mdash;you might want to explore more independent options like those available with privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies.

> &#x1F4A1; This is part 2 of [{{ site.title }}'s "Using Cryptocurrency" series for providers]({% link resources/for-providers/using-cryptocurrency/index.md %}). Still need some convincing for my cryptocurrency is important for providers to get on board with? Read my [cryptocurrency primer for providers]({% link resources/for-providers/using-cryptocurrency/primer.md %}).

A lot of people think getting started with cryptocurrency is hard. That might have been true a number of years ago, but it's not anymore. There are really good, easy to use apps, often called "wallets" or, more precisely, "wallet apps," that make setting up your cryptocurrency "accounts" really fast.

## Choose and install your wallet app

Choosing a wallet app is really important. In some ways, it's a bit like choosing a Web browser. Different people have different needs, preferences, and even aesthetic choices. For me, as a sex worker and as a technologist, the most important considerations are which wallet:

- supports the private cryptocurrencies (Zcash and/or Monero) I need to use, and
- operates in a self-custodial way so I'm not re-introducing the risks of being de-banked by using a third-party service.

These are my two deal-breakers. If the wallet app doesn't support Zcash or Monero, then it's basically useless to me because it won't support the privacy-preserving technologies I rely on to keep my financial data private. Similarly, if the wallet app doesn't work in a self-custody manner, then it's not really a wallet, it's a teller window at a bank, which means I don't actually have any of my money on my person. (The bank is holding on to it for me.)

In addition to the two above considerations, I would also like my wallet app to work with some other time-tested privacy tools so that not only my financial transactions but also my use of the Internet is kept private and secure.

The cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves quickly, but as of this writing there are two very clear winners. I'll show you both.

### Zashi: Privacy-focused Zcash wallet app

If you're going to use Zcash (and I think you should; Zcash is the gold standard in private cryptocurrency technologies), the best wallet app to use is [Zashi Wallet](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/){:target="_blank"}. Zashi is a mobile phone app that can run on Apple iOS or Android devices, including [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/), the privacy-focused, de-Google-ified Android alternative. It is by far one of the easiest and most privacy-protecting Zcash wallet app.

{:.align-center}
[Go install Zashi now](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/){:.button target="_blank"}

Zashi has some special features that make it especially attractive for sex workers:

- if you ever make a mistake and share your non-private (unshielded, or transparent) receive address for a client or customer to send you funds, Zashi automatically shields (makes private) your money for you. In the privacy coin ecosystem, we call this behavior "auto-shielding."
- every time you share your address with a client or customer from the app, Zashi automatically rotates your address for you and then keeps track of which addresses received money. We call this address auto-rotation, and it's yet another way to help you avoid revealing information about who you are in case you ever communicate about your cryptocurrency addresses over unsecured communication channels (like texting).
- whenever you need to pay for something, like your ads, you can send your payment in a huge range of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin directly from your Zcash wallet using your Zcash balance all in one screen. This is a big deal for sex workers in particular because the way it works using a technology called a decentralized exchange (or *DEX*) that has no link at all to your wallet even when you're paying in non-private cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. More on this later.
- you can "set and forget" extra and powerful privacy protections provided by the [Tor Project](https://torproject.org/){:target="_blank"} from within the app itself. I do recommend doing this, and will show you how.

I think Zashi is fast becoming the killer app for anyone who's at risk of being de-banked from the traditional financial system. As a self-custodial, auto-shielding, address-rotating, Torified, Zcash wallet with a fully private decentralized off-ramp to literally dozens upon dozens of supported cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, it's the one wallet we as sex workers should be using today if we can only use one wallet app.

The one caveat (for now) is that Zashi only supports *receiving* funds in Zcash. This means your client or customer will need to get Zcash to pay you, but thankfully this is very easy and can be done within the app itself, too. Moreover, the Zashi developers have accounced that this limitation is being worked on as well. For now, though, if you can't convince your clients or customers to send you Zcash, you'll need a second wallet that supports something they do want to send you.

For that, there's also good news. Just read on.

### Cake Wallet: Privacy-focused Monero wallet app

If, for some reason, you want to use Monero instead of (or in addition to) Zcash, or if you need a privacy-focused wallet app that can accept something other than Zcash, look at [Cake Wallet](https://cakewallet.com/){:target="_blank"}.

{:.align-center}
[Go install Cake Wallet now](https://docs.cakewallet.com/get-started/#installing-cake-wallet){:.button target="_blank"}

Cake Wallet is perhaps most popular within the Monero community because, like Zashi, it is a self-custodial wallet app (although they call themselves "non-custodial," which means the same thing) that supports address auto-rotation and has Tor integration built-in. Unlike Zashi, Cake Wallet supports a whole slew of different cryptocurrencies, including non-private cryptocurrencies like old school Bitcoin proper. This means that you need to know a little bit more about what you're doing when you're using Cake Wallet than when you're using Zashi, but it's still pretty easy to figure out.

In addition, Cake Wallet also supports some other nice privacy-preserving features. These include:

- in-app currency swaps via [Trocador](https://noscript.trocador.app){:target="_blank"}, a currency exchange proxy site. If you need to turn your Monero into Bitcoin, or your Bitcoin into Monero, you can use Trocador's service from directly within the Cake Wallet app to do this easily. And you can turn on Cake Wallet's built-in Tor support for extra protection when using Trocador.

### Using multiple wallet apps

As I write this, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is very fragmented. Different wallet apps work with different cryptocurrencies, different "coins" are available on different "chains" as "tokens." It's all very confusing and annoying.

One of the effects of this fragmentation is that it's likely you'll find yourself needing to use more than one wallet.

However, if you stick with Zashi for your Zcash and Cake Wallet for your Monero and your Bitcoin (or Ethereum or whatever other non-private cryptocurrency you're ultimately pushed to use), you'll cover what I estimate is 80-90% of your use cases.

I personally use Zashi most often. After that, I use Cake Wallet. For what it's worth, if you really want to explore wallets and feel comfortable getting a bit adventurous with your choices, I also like [Edge Wallet](https://edge.app/){:target="_blank"} and [Ywallet](https://ywallet.app/){:target="_blank"}.

## Open your wallet app and you're good to go

This is the surprising part for a lot of people: once you open your self-custodial wallet app, you're immediately able to receive payments. That's literally all there is to it. No need to enter a name, make an account, verify your age, or prove your government identity. Get the right kind of wallet app, and you're instantly set up to make sales and accept deposits or payments, albeit interactively.

In a little more detail, here's what happens when you open a self-custody wallet app for the first time.

When you install your wallet app of choice, it automatically generated what's called a wallet seed phrase, or recovery phrase, or BIP32/BIP39/BIP44 mnemonic code, or something to that effect. This is a fancy way of saying "the wallet app made up a secret passphrase that gives you control over your money." All of those terms mean the same thing.

Your wallet's seed phrase is usually a sequence of 12 to 24 words that, as soon as you start caring about your funds, you should probably write down somewhere safe. (I suggest using a password manager like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com){:target="_blank"}.) Eventually, you may even want to memorize it. This secret recovery seed phrase or whatever you want to call it is your magic money spell, the incantation you can invoke to "magically" conjure your money using any wallet app that supports both your cryptocurrency and your recovery phrase algorithm. (Almost all modern wallets support this cool feature, now.) If you memorize these words in the right order, you can do some amazingly sci-fi-esque shit, like cross international borders carrying nothing at all, and still emerge on the other side able to access your funds again as soon as you get your hands on a smartphone with an Internet connection. It's like you're a mashup of Trinity from The Matrix and Natasha Romanov from the Marvel Cinemantic Universe or something. It's crazy that this works, but it does!

This seed phrase is actually the input to a cryptographic algorithm that's used to deterministically generate a multitude of cryptocurrency addresses that you fully control. Only you can see the value they store, and only you have the power to spend from those addresses. (That's why you don't want to share this secret phrase with anyone else; anyone who knows the secret phrase will have the same power you do.) Despite generating a ton of addresses that may, over time, contain different amounts, your wallet app sums them all to show you a single, total balance.

In every wallet app, you'll see a button labelled "Receive." This is the button you press to, you guessed it, ask other people to send you some of whatever cryptocurrency the wallet app supports. That's what we'll need to start getting crypto.

## On-ramping: Acquiring cryptocurrency funds

Now that you have a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency wallet app and can receive funds in a privacy coin like Zcash or Monero, it's time to start acquiring some funds. The cryptocurrency world calls this "on-ramping," using the analogy of a highway on-ramp from one place (the fiat economy) to another (the so-called "crypto-native" economy, or whatever).

### On-ramp by getting paid directly in crypto

I'll be blunt: the easiest way for many of us to start getting crypto is to just get a client or customer to pay or tip us in cryptocurrency. This is also arguably one of the most private ways because it simply avoids any interaction with the fiat economy entirely. This is of course even better and more private if we get paid with a privacy coin like Zcash or Monero and don't have to do convert, exchange, or swap it into one of these privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies.

To get paid this way, find the "Receive" button in your wallet app. Every wallet app makes this button very big and clear, because everyone likes getting paid and that's what wallet apps are for. Tap or click the Receive button and you'll be presented with options to reveal the full address, a QR code of the address, and sometimes also other ways to share the address such as by sharing a link. (This is exactly [how my own cryptocurrency tips and donation links work]({% link colophon.md %}#cryptocurrency-tips-and-donation-links), by the way.)

Send the address or the generated QR code to your client or customer however you're already talking with them. Ideally, you're communicating over [Signal Private Messenger](https://Signal.org/){:target="_blank"}, but it doesn't really matter. Any method of sending them some text or an image, including email or text message, will work. Have them press the complementary "Send" button in their wallet app, enter the address you gave them, whether via copy-and-paste or by scanning the QR code you showed them, and you'll have your money a few moments after they confirm the transaction on their side.

Zashi even has a "Request" button in its "Receive" screen that lets you enter an amount you'd like to receive and embeds this amount into a QR code that you can display, or save as an image to send. If they also have Zashi (or any other wallet app that supports Zcash QR codes), they can just scan the QR code to send you exactly that amount of money in Zcash's cryptocurrency, called *ZEC, the Zcash Electric Coin*.

You can think of this "request via QR code" feature like a simplistic point-of-sale system. I love it because it's perfect for us as providers since we're so often interactively requesting payment from customers and clients who need things to be as easy as "scan-and-send."

For some of us, however, getting paid directly in crypto seems like a stretch. Our clients or customers are wary of cryptocurrency, they don't have the technical skill to do it, they have no existing cryptocurrency funds themselves, or they don't have the same cryptocurrencies that we want to accept payments in. I'll address all of these points in my next guide, ["How and why to convince clients and customers to pay us in cryptocurrency"]({% link resources/for-providers/using-cryptocurrency/convince-clients.md %}) but, for now, let's talk about on-ramping in other ways.

### On-ramp by converting fiat currency to cryptocurrency

If you have existing fiat currency, like US Dollars (USD), Euros (EUR), or whatever, the simplest way to acquire Zcash funds ("ZEC") or Monero ("XMR") is to buy it. This works like any other foreign currency conversion. By way of analogy, when you're converting fiat currencies from one to another, you go to a currency exchange counter such as those that are at airports. There, you ask the person at the currency exchange service counter for an equivalent amount of the local currency given your available foreign currency.

Fiat-to-cryptocurrency conversions work just like that, except instead of going up to a physical counter, you visit the currency conversion service's website. Many such fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges exist. Today, the biggest and most famous of these are Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, all of which will convert your fiat currency to Zcash.

While this method is very easy, the downside is that in *some* situations, you may be asked to show your government ID to the exchange, especially if you're trying to convert currencies in large amounts. This can be a big privacy risk if you've previously used that exchange's services to make other kinds of transactions that you don't want linked to you legal identity. In this case, consider creating a brand-new account from scratch.

The good news is that it's in no way shady to be buying privacy coins. These are just currencies and securities like any other. But by choosing to purchase a privacy coin, once you receive your ZEC or XMR, you can move it about freely and privately. You've effectively freed your money.

#### Buy ZEC in Zashi via Coinbase

Perhaps the easiest way to convert your fiat currency to ZEC is once again to start within Zashi. Since Zashi supports both transparent (public) and shielded (private) Zcash addresses, you can convert your fiat currency into ZEC destined directly for your Zashi wallet.

At Zashi's main screen, there's a "More" button with an ellipsis. Tapping on it will reveal a number of additional options, one of which reads "Buy ZEC with Coinbase." Tap that to open your Web browser to the Coinbase Onramp website, where you can pay for ZEC with your credit, debit, or other fiat electronic payment app and, once purchased, have your ZEC sent directly to your Zashi wallet.

For regulatory compliance reasons, most big exchanges don't support Zcash's shielded mode, which means buying ZEC with fiat currency is one of a very small number of situations in which you may need to provide your transparent address (sometimes called a "t-addr") to the exchange to buy your ZEC. However, once purchased and sent directly to your Zashi wallet, the app will automatically shield your funds, making them private again.

> &#x1F4A1; As of this writing (August 2025), [Gemini is the one cryptocurrency exchange I'm aware of that supports Zcash's shielded addresses](https://www.gemini.com/blog/youre-one-step-closer-to-financial-freedom-with-shielded-zec-withdrawals){:target="_blank"}, including the universal address format that Zashi uses.

It's important to note that buying ZEC from one of these big exchanges and sending it directly to your Zashi wallet app is not the same as buying ZEC and then keeping it in the account you created at the exchange from which you bought the ZEC. By moving your funds directly from the exchange into your Zashi wallet app immediately, you are doing the equivalent of withdrawing your money from the bank so you can hold onto it (and protect it) yourself.

#### Buy Monero in Cake Wallet

> I still need to write this section. It's basically the same as the above; go into Cake Wallet, hit the "Buy" button, and get some XMR into your wallet via whatever exchange they support.

### Know Your "Know Your Customer" Rules

> I still need to write this section. It's basically like this, though:
>
> 1. Buy cryptocurrency (ideally, Monero) from a KYC'ed exchange account to its custodial wallet.
> 1. Get an HD self-custodial wallet app (like Cake Wallet) that supports address rotation and make a new wallet for your newly purchased cryptocurrency.
> 1. Send the crypto from your exchange account wallet to your self-custodial wallet. Voila.
> 1. If necessary, swap your transparent ledger crypto via Trocador or NEAR intents into a privacy coin and send it to your own self-custodial wallet at a new, never-before-used address.

Whenever you're asked to provide your legal identity documents to verify your financial accounts, you're encountering a class of financial regulations called *Know Your Customer (KYC) rules*. These rules are ostensibly designed to keep the financial system safe and free of fraudsters. But they can adversely affect a lot of people, gatekeeping participation in the financial system frustratingly out of reach. For sex workers in particular, they can also be outright physically dangerous to fall afoul of, because it means risking getting doxxed.

Nevertheless, sometimes we can't avoid them and, thanks to privacy coin technologies, it's possible to participate in KYC'ed cryptocurrency exchanges while still safely compartmentalizing our public working persona from our private legal identities.

Here's how you do it:

## Off-ramping: where and how to spend your cryptocurrency

At the end of the day, cryptocurrency is just currency. You can't breathe it, you can't eat it, you can't drink it. It won't provide companionship, fulfillment, inspiration, or joy. A number in a bank account, even a cryptocurrency account, won't keep you alive. Sooner or later, you're going to have to spend it on something.

The cryptocurrency world calls this "off-ramping," the complement to "on-ramping." In this case, it means turning your cryptocurrency assets into something else, whether digital or physical.

In the traditional financial system, spending money comes with a privacy trade-off: your bank, credit card company, or payment processor knows what you're up to. Transparent (non-private) cryptocurrency systems suffer from the same problem, but worse, because everyone in the entire world can watch what you buy. This is one of the main safety benefits to using privacy coins: no one but you and the vendor you're buying from knows what you're up to.

### Off-ramp by paying directly in cryptocurrency

The easiest way to off-ramp or spend your cryptocurrency is to just pay for the thing in the same privacy coin you already have. Of course, this requires the vendor to accept payments in that privacy coin, and that's still rare.

It's worth pointing out that, as sex workers, we are actually quite a skilled bunch. As I'm sure you know (and as [I've said before](https://bsky.app/profile/violetrollergirl.com/post/3lx34gxh3tk2i){:target="_blank"}), sex work requires myriad skills, and most sex workers are gig workers, which means you can support many of the sex workers you know even without buying hole or pole from us. I personally know colleagues who are editors, tailors, graphic designers, leather workers, bartenders, computer programmers, cooks, tutors, and nannies who also do sex work as a supplemental income.

Community's always been important but it'll become more so very rapidly. If the quality is there, I'd rather get my blouse sewn by a fellow sex worker I know or one who is recommended to me by a friend. And, guess what, if they're willing to accept payment for that service in Zcash, I've got my perfect off-ramp right there!

So if you're a sex worker with such skills, share that fact with friends you trust. Build a local economy, and stay surveillance-free by using Zcash to sustain it! The true revolutionary potential of this truly cannot be overstated.

One way to think about this is: Zcash in Zashi is to money what Signal Private Messenger is to speech. Vive la révolution!

### Paying in Bitcoin when you only have Zcash

One very common need we have is to pay for our escort ads. Many escort directories and mall sites will accept payment in Bitcoin, but I'm aware of none who accept Zcash. (Obviously, if you know of one, please [contact](#contact) me to tell me about it!) Thankfully, once again Zashi comes to the rescue with a [decentralized off-ramp for shielded ZEC built into Zashi itself](https://electriccoin.co/blog/live-in-zashi-decentralized-off-ramp-for-shielded-zec/){:target="_blank"}.

Let's say you have some ZEC and you want to [load up your Tryst TLC balance](https://help.tryst.link/en-gb/22-payments-accounts/86-managing-your-membership){:target="_blank"}. Here's what you can do:

1. First, since you already have ZEC in Zashi, it's shielded and private. This means no matter how you got it, it bears no digital link back to your legal identity. This is a much better place to start than any other Bitcoin address.
1. Log in to your Tryst account and access their "[Add credits](https://app.tryst.link/members/orders/new){:target="_blank"}" screen.
1. Since this is your first time paying in ZEC, choose to purchase a small "Custom" amount of TLC, maybe 15 or so.
1. Make sure you indicate that you want to pay in Bitcoin. You're actually going to be paying directly from your shielded Zcash, but Tryst will nevertheless receive Bitcoin anyway.
1. Click the "Next" button to proceed to [the Tryst order summary screen](https://help.tryst.link/en-gb/22/146){:target="_blank"}.
1. Review your purchase order and press the "Pay Now" button to reveal the Bitcoin pay window. Tryst will show you a QR code that's similar to Zashi's "Request" screen, with an amount already embedded in it. That's nice, but we're not going to use it.
1. Click on the "Copy" tab to reveal just the Bitcoin address that Tryst is expecting to receive your payment at.
1. Click on the address itself (*not* the "payment link") to copy the Bitcoin address to your clipboard. Keep a note of this address somewhere, like a text window or just in your clipboard. We'll need it later.
1. Now, open Zashi.
1. Click on Zashi's "More&hellip;" button to reveal its menu of advanced options.
1. Choose "Swap ZEC with NEAR Intents," which is currently the first (top) item in the resulting menu.
1. Enter an amount slightly *more* than the amount of the purchase order you requested from Tryst. For example, if you asked for 15 TLC (which maps directly to 15 Euro), enter an amount of ZEC equivalent to 20 Euros. Zashi will show you the current exchange rate, and you can also tap the up-and-down-arrows icon underneath the payment entry amount field to switch from entering ZEC to entering your chosen fiat currency.
1. Beneath this field is a drop-down menu for selecting the currency we are going to pay in. Find `BTC` from the list of options; it will have a small Bitcoin logo on top of a larger, second, identical Bitcoin logo. This means we're using our shielded ZEC, but paying in Bitcoin.
1. Make sure the fiat amount of BTC shows up as larger than the purchase order amount you requested from Tryst.
1. In the `Address` field, paste the Bitcoin payment address you copied from Tryst earlier.
1. Click "Get a quote" at the bottom of the Zashi Swap with NEAR screen.
1. Confirm you want to make the exchange, and send the transaction.

In my experience, it takes about 5 to 10 minutes for the transaction to complete.

There's a lot happening here, but what's extra cool about this is that at no point do you need a Bitcoin wallet, nor does any remnant of digital cruft exist anywhere in the blockchain that can be linked back to you. You can keep your cryptocurrency assets in the Zcash shielded pool, completely privately, and now pay any vendor who accepts any denomination of cryptocurrency that's supported in this neat little feature equally privately.

This is in fact how I pay for [my Tryst membership]({% link index.html %}#links-tryst).

### Off-ramp by using crypto-to-fiat sites

Another way to spend your hard-earned cryptocurrency is to use dedicated services at sites designed for off-ramping. These include:

- [Bitrefill](https://www.bitrefill.com/){:target="_blank"}, a site that sells gift cards to a plethory of well-known brands by accepting cryptocurrency as payment for them
- [Travala](https://www.travala.com/){:target="_blank"}, a site designed for booking hotels, flights, tours, and other activities with crypto

### Off-ramp by using Flexa in Zashi

> I need to write this up, too. Basically it's just Flexa integration within Zashi, so you can buy, like, Chipotle meals or whatever else Flexa supports by paying with ZEC from within the app. It's cool, but generic.
