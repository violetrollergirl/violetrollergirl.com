# Start using cryptocurrency today, as a sex worker

If you, like me, participate in any part of the economy that risks your ability to participate in traditional banking systems&mdash;even legal sex work like modeling on OnlyFans can get your bank account flagged&mdash;you might want to explore more independent options like those available with privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies.

> &#x1F4A1; This is part 2 of [{{ site.title }}'s "Using Cryptocurrency" series for providers]({% link resources/for-providers/using-cryptocurrency/index.md %}). Still need some convincing for my cryptocurrency is important for providers to get on board with? Read my [cryptocurrency primer for providers]({% link resources/for-providers/using-cryptocurrency/primer.md %}).

A lot of people think getting started with cryptocurrency is hard. That might have been true a number of years ago, but it's not anymore. There are really good, easy to use apps, often called "wallets" or, more precisely, "wallet apps," that make setting up your cryptocurrency "accounts" really fast.

## Choose and install your wallet app

Choosing a wallet app is really important. In some ways, it's a bit like choosing a Web browser. Different people have different needs, preferences, and even aesthetic choices. For me, as a sex worker and as a technologist, the most important considerations are which wallet:

- supports the private cryptocurrencies (Zcash and/or Monero) I need to use, and
- operates in a self-custodial way so I'm not re-introducing the risks of being de-banked by using a third-party service.

These are my two deal-breakers. If the wallet app doesn't support Zcash or Monero, then it's basically useless to me because it won't support the privacy-preserving technologies I rely on to keep my financial data private. Similarly, if the wallet app doesn't work in a self-custody manner, then it's not really a wallet, it's a teller window at a bank, which means I don't actually have any of my money on my person. (The bank is holding on to it for me.)

In addition to the two above considerations, I would also like my wallet app to work with some other time-tested privacy tools so that not only my financial transactions but also my use of the Internet is kept private and secure.

The cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves quickly, but as of this writing there are two very clear winners. I'll show you both.

### Zashi: Privacy-focused Zcash wallet app

If you're going to use Zcash (and I think you should; Zcash is the gold standard in private cryptocurrency technologies), the best wallet app to use is [Zashi Wallet](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/){:target="_blank"}. Zashi is a mobile phone app that can run on Apple iOS or Android devices, including [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/), the privacy-focused, de-Google-ified Android alternative. It is by far one of the easiest and most privacy-protecting Zcash wallet app.

Zashi has some special features that make it especially attractive for sex workers:

- if you ever make a mistake and share your non-private (unshielded, or transparent) receive address for a client or customer to send you funds, Zashi automatically shields (makes private) your money for you. In the privacy coin ecosystem, we call this behavior "auto-shielding."
- every time you share your address with a client or customer from the app, Zashi automatically rotates your address for you and then keeps track of which addresses received money. We call this address auto-rotation, and it's yet another way to help you avoid revealing information about who you are in case you ever communicate about your cryptocurrency addresses over unsecured communication channels (like texting).
- whenever you need to pay for something, like your ads, you can send your payment in a huge range of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin directly from your Zcash wallet using your Zcash balance all in one screen. This is a big deal for sex workers in particular because the way it works using a technology called a decentralized exchange (or *DEX*) that has no link at all to your wallet even when you're paying in non-private cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. More on this later.
- you can "set and forget" extra and powerful privacy protections provided by the [Tor Project](https://torproject.org/){:target="_blank"} from within the app itself. I do recommend doing this, and will show you how.

I think Zashi is fast becoming the killer app for anyone who's at risk of being de-banked from the traditional financial system. As a self-custodial, auto-shielding, address-rotating, Torified, Zcash wallet with a fully private decentralized off-ramp to literally dozens upon dozens of supported cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, it's the one wallet we as sex workers should be using today if we can only use one wallet app.

The one caveat (for now) is that Zashi only supports *receiving* funds in Zcash. This means your client or customer will need to get Zcash to pay you, but thankfully this is very easy and can be done within the app itself, too. Moreover, the Zashi developers have accounced that this limitation is being worked on as well. For now, though, if you can't convince your clients or customers to send you Zcash, you'll need a second wallet that supports something they do want to send you.

For that, there's also good news. Just read on.

### Cake Wallet: Privacy-focused Monero wallet app

If, for some reason, you want to use Monero instead of (or in addition to) Zcash, or if you need a privacy-focused wallet app that can accept something other than Zcash, look at [Cake Wallet](https://cakewallet.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Cake Wallet is perhaps most popular within the Monero community because, like Zashi, it is a self-custodial wallet app (although they call themselves "non-custodial," which means the same thing) that supports address auto-rotation and has Tor integration built-in. Unlike Zashi, Cake Wallet supports a whole slew of different cryptocurrencies, including non-private cryptocurrencies like old school Bitcoin proper. This means that you need to know a little bit more about what you're doing when you're using Cake Wallet than when you're using Zashi, but it's still pretty easy to figure out.

In addition, Cake Wallet also supports some other nice privacy-preserving features. These include:

- in-app currency swaps via [Trocador](https://noscript.trocador.app){:target="_blank"}, a currency exchange proxy site. If you need to turn your Monero into Bitcoin, or your Bitcoin into Monero, you can use Trocador's service from directly within the Cake Wallet app to do this easily. And you can turn on Cake Wallet's built-in Tor support for extra protection when using Trocador.

### Using multiple wallet apps

As I write this, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is very fragmented. Different wallet apps work with different cryptocurrencies, different "coins" are available on different "chains" as "tokens." It's all very confusing and annoying.

One of the effects of this fragmentation is that it's likely you'll find yourself needing to use more than one wallet.

However, if you stick with Zashi for your Zcash and Cake Wallet for your Monero and your Bitcoin (or Ethereum or whatever other non-private cryptocurrency you're ultimately pushed to use), you'll cover what I estimate is 80-90% of your use cases.

I personally use Zashi most often. After that, I use Cake Wallet. For what it's worth, if you really want to explore wallets and feel comfortable getting a bit adventurous with your choices, I also like [Edge Wallet](https://edge.app/){:target="_blank"} and [Ywallet](https://ywallet.app/){:target="_blank"}.

## Open your wallet app and you're good to go

This is the surprising part for a lot of people: once you open your wallet app, you're immediately able to receive payments. That's literally all there is to it. Get a wallet app, and you are instantly set up to make sales, accept deposits, and accept payments, albeit interactively.

In a little more detail, here's what I mean.

When you install your wallet app of choice, it automatically generated what's called a wallet seed phrase, or recovery phrase, or BIP32/BIP39/BIP44 mnemonic code, or something to that effect, which is a fancy way of saying "the secret passphrase that gives you control over your money." All of those things mean the same thing: a sequence of 12 to 24 words that, as soon as you start caring about your funds, you should probably write down somewhere safe (I suggest using a password manager like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com){:target="_blank"}), if not memorize. This secret recovery seed phrase or whatever you want to call it is your magic money spell, the incantation you can invoke to "magically" conjure your money using any wallet app that supports both your cryptocurrency and your recovery phrase algorithm. (Almost all modern wallets support this cool feature, now.) If you memorize these words, in this order, you can do some amazingly sci-fi-esque shit like cross international borders, get strip-searched, and still emerge on the other side able to access your savings as soon as you get access to a smartphone again.

It's like you're like a mashup of Trinity from The Matrix and Natasha Romanov from the Marvel Cinemantic Universe or something. It's crazy that this works, but it does!

In every wallet app, you'll see a button labelled "Receive." This is the button you press to, you guessed it, ask other people to send you some of whatever cryptocurrency the wallet app supports. Tap or click it and you'll be presented with options to reveal the full address, a QR code of the address, and sometimes also other ways to share the address such as by sharing a link. This is exactly [how my own cryptocurrency tips and donation links work]({% link colophon.md %}#cryptocurrency-tips-and-donation-links).

Zashi even has a "Request" button in its "Receive" screen that lets you enter an amount you'd like to receive and embeds this amount into a QR code that you can show someone. If they also have Zashi, they can just scan it to send you exactly that amount of money in Zcash's cryptocurrency, called *ZEC, the Zcash Electric Coin*. You can think of it like a simplistic point-of-sale system, and it's perfect for us as providers since we're often interactively requesting payment from customers and clients who need things to be as easy as "scan-and-send."

## On-ramping: Acquiring cryptocurrency funds

Now that you have a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency wallet app and can receive funds in a privacy coin like Zcash or Monero, you should start acquiring some funds. The cryptocurrency world calls this "on-ramping," using the analogy of a highway on-ramp from one place (the fiat economy) to another (the so-called "crypto-native" economy, or whatever).

I'll be blunt: the easiest way for many of us to do this is to just get a client or customer to pay us in cryptocurrency. This is also arguably one of the most private ways, because as far as we're concerned, it means we simply avoid any interaction with the fiat economy entirely. This is of course even better and more private if we get paid directly in a privacy coin.

For some of us, however, this seems like a stretch. Our clients or customers are wary of cryptocurrency, they don't have the technical skill to do it, they have no existing cryptocurrency funds, or they don't have the same cryptocurrencies that we want to accept. I'll address all of these points in my next guide, ["How and why to convince clients and customers to pay us in cryptocurrency"]({% link resources/for-providers/using-cryptocurrency/convince-clients.md %}) but, for now, let's talk about on-ramping in other ways.
