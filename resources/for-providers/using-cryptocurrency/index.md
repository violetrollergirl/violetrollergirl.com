# {{ site.title }}'s Resources for Providers Using Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency gets a bad rap and, in many situations, this is deserved. Most of the "crypto" sector is just not relevant, not helpful, and not intended for us as sex workers.

I hope these short, stand alone articles help you better understand why there are real benefits to using cryptocurrency, what those benefits are, and how to capitalize on them in your day-to-day dealings as a sex worker.
