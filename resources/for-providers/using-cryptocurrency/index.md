Cryptocurrency gets a bad rap and, in many situations, it's deserved. Most of the "crypto" sector is just not relevant, not helpful, and not intended for us as sex workers. However, there is a sliver of really powerful stuff in there, and I want to normalize that slice of it because I truly believe that doing so is vital to protecting ourselves, our clients, and our financial futures.

I hope these short, stand alone articles help you better understand why there are real benefits to using the good parts of what cryptocurrency makes possible, what those benefits are, and how to capitalize on them in your day-to-day dealings as a sex worker.

## Start using cryptocurrency today, as a sex worker

If you, like me, participate in any part of the economy that risks your ability to safely engage with traditional banking systems&mdash;even legal sex work like modeling on OnlyFans can get your bank account flagged or shut down&mdash;you might want to explore more independent financial options like those available with privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies.

The following is a series of articles I've written in the hopes of helping you gradually move more and more of your financial life towards safe and private cryptocurrencies and away from (often discriminatory) traditional banking institutions and the implicit surveillance they subject you and all the people you transact with to.
