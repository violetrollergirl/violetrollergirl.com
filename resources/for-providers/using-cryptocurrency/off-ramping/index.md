# Off-ramping: where and how to spend your cryptocurrency

At the end of the day, cryptocurrency is just currency. You can't breathe it, you can't eat it, you can't drink it. It won't provide companionship, fulfillment, inspiration, or joy. A number in a bank account, or a cryptocurrency wallet, won't keep you alive. Sooner or later, you're going to have to spend it on something.

The cryptocurrency world calls this "off-ramping," the complement to "on-ramping." In this case, it means turning your cryptocurrency assets into something else, whether digital or physical.

In the traditional financial system, spending money comes with a privacy trade-off: your bank, credit card company, or payment processor knows what you're up to. Transparent (non-private) cryptocurrency systems suffer from the same problem, but worse, because everyone in the entire world can watch what you buy. This is one of the main safety benefits to using privacy coins: no one but you and the vendor you're buying from knows what you're up to.

## Paying directly in cryptocurrency

The easiest way to off-ramp or spend your cryptocurrency is to just pay for the thing in the same privacy coin you already have. Of course, this requires the vendor to accept payments in that privacy coin, and that's still rare.

It's worth pointing out that, as sex workers, we are actually quite a skilled bunch. As I'm sure you know (and as [I've said before](https://bsky.app/profile/violetrollergirl.com/post/3lx34gxh3tk2i){:target="_blank"}), sex work requires myriad skills, and most sex workers are gig workers, which means you can support many of the sex workers you know even without buying hole or pole from us. I personally know colleagues who are editors, tailors, graphic designers, leather workers, bartenders, computer programmers, cooks, tutors, and nannies who also do sex work as a supplemental income.

Community's always been important but it'll become more so very rapidly. If the quality is there, I'd rather get my blouse sewn by a fellow sex worker I know or one who is recommended to me by a friend. And, guess what, if they're willing to accept payment for that service in Zcash, I've got my perfect off-ramp right there!

So if you're a sex worker with such skills, share that fact with friends you trust. Build a local economy, and stay surveillance-free by using Zcash to sustain it! The true revolutionary potential of this truly cannot be overstated.

One way to think about this is: Zcash in Zashi is to money what Signal Private Messenger is to speech. Vive la rÃ©volution!

### Paying in Bitcoin when you only have Zcash

One very common need we have is to pay for our escort ads. Many escort directories and mall sites will accept payment in Bitcoin, but I'm aware of none who accept Zcash. (Obviously, if you know of one, please [contact](#contact) me to tell me about it!) Thankfully, once again Zashi comes to the rescue with a [decentralized off-ramp for shielded ZEC built into Zashi itself](https://electriccoin.co/blog/live-in-zashi-decentralized-off-ramp-for-shielded-zec/){:target="_blank"}.

Let's say you have some ZEC and you want to [load up your Tryst TLC balance](https://help.tryst.link/en-gb/22-payments-accounts/86-managing-your-membership){:target="_blank"}. Here's what you can do:

1. First, since you already have ZEC in Zashi, it's shielded and private. This means no matter how you got it, it bears no digital link back to your legal identity. This is a much better place to start than any other Bitcoin address.
1. Log in to your Tryst account and access their "[Add credits](https://app.tryst.link/members/orders/new){:target="_blank"}" screen.
1. Since this is your first time paying in ZEC, choose to purchase a small "Custom" amount of TLC, maybe 15 or so.
1. Make sure you indicate that you want to pay in Bitcoin. You're actually going to be paying directly from your shielded Zcash, but Tryst will nevertheless receive Bitcoin anyway.
1. Click the "Next" button to proceed to [the Tryst order summary screen](https://help.tryst.link/en-gb/22/146){:target="_blank"}.
1. Review your purchase order and press the "Pay Now" button to reveal the Bitcoin pay window. Tryst will show you a QR code that's similar to Zashi's "Request" screen, with an amount already embedded in it. That's nice, but we're not going to use it.
1. Click on the "Copy" tab to reveal just the Bitcoin address that Tryst is expecting to receive your payment at.
1. Click on the address itself (*not* the "payment link") to copy the Bitcoin address to your clipboard. Keep a note of this address somewhere, like a text window or just in your clipboard. We'll need it later.
1. Now, open Zashi.
1. Click on Zashi's "More&hellip;" button to reveal its menu of advanced options.
1. Choose "Swap ZEC with NEAR Intents," which is currently the first (top) item in the resulting menu.
1. Enter an amount slightly *more* than the amount of the purchase order you requested from Tryst. For example, if you asked for 15 TLC (which maps directly to 15 Euro), enter an amount of ZEC equivalent to 20 Euros. Zashi will show you the current exchange rate, and you can also tap the up-and-down-arrows icon underneath the payment entry amount field to switch from entering ZEC to entering your chosen fiat currency.
1. Beneath this field is a drop-down menu for selecting the currency we are going to pay in. Find `BTC` from the list of options; it will have a small Bitcoin logo on top of a larger, second, identical Bitcoin logo. This means we're using our shielded ZEC, but paying in Bitcoin.
1. Make sure the fiat amount of BTC shows up as larger than the purchase order amount you requested from Tryst.
1. In the `Address` field, paste the Bitcoin payment address you copied from Tryst earlier.
1. Click "Get a quote" at the bottom of the Zashi Swap with NEAR screen.
1. Confirm you want to make the exchange, and send the transaction.

In my experience, it takes about 5 to 10 minutes for the transaction to complete.

There's a lot happening here, but what's extra cool about this is that at no point do you need a Bitcoin wallet, nor does any remnant of digital cruft exist anywhere in the blockchain that can be linked back to you. You can keep your cryptocurrency assets in the Zcash shielded pool, completely privately, and now pay any vendor who accepts any denomination of cryptocurrency that's supported in this neat little feature equally privately.

This is in fact how I pay for [my Tryst membership]({% link index.html %}#links-tryst).

## Use specialty gift card and exchange service providers

Another way to spend your hard-earned cryptocurrency is to use dedicated services at sites designed for off-ramping. These include:

- [Bitrefill](https://www.bitrefill.com/){:target="_blank"}, a site that sells gift cards to a plethory of well-known brands by accepting cryptocurrency as payment for them
- [Travala](https://www.travala.com/){:target="_blank"}, a site designed for booking hotels, flights, tours, and other activities with crypto

### Pay for stuff via Flexa in Zashi

> I need to write this up, too. Basically it's just Flexa integration within Zashi, so you can buy, like, Chipotle meals or whatever else Flexa supports by paying with ZEC from within the app. It's cool, but generic.

## Put yourself on a crypto payroll with Opolis

> This needs a write up, as well. It basically involves engaging the services of an independent worker's cooperative such as [Opolis](https://opolis.co/){:target="_blank"} and then paying them crypto for which they will give you fiat currency in exchange, as an employed worker. This also means you can get health benefits with their plan, and so on. More to come about this exciting option!

## Convert crypto back to fiat currency

> I need to write this up, too. Basically it's just going back to an exchange where you are okay KYC'ing to your fiat identity.
