# {{ site.title}}'s Resources for Clients

This page lists resources I've created to help clients.

## [Booking guide]({% link resources/for-clients/booking-guide/index.md %})

Many people are attracted to trans women like me, but few get the chance to get intimate with us. One of my favorite things about being a trans provider is sharing in that moment of discovery with you, and relishing the joy, relief, and opening of possibility that comes with it. To experience that, of course, you must first book me.

I wrote this booking guide to help those of you who want a meticulously crafted step-by-step walk through to follow for booking time with me. It explains how to start and what to do at every step of the way. Its extraordinary detail may be overkill for many of you, but provides a thorough reference regardless.

## [Using cryptocurrency]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/index.md %})

Cryptocurrency is now a popular way to pay providers. Some providers, like me, even prefer it over every other form of payment. If you're new to using cryptocurrency, it can feel a little daunting the first time, but using it smartly can offer some really helpful privacy and security benefits. Besides, you only need to set things up once.

My cryptocurrency explainers are designed to help you get set up and ready to send payments from your digital wallet or crypto account(s) as quickly and simply as possible.
