# {{ site.title}}'s Resources for Clients

This page lists resources I've created to help clients.

## [Booking guide]({% link resources/for-clients/booking-guide/index.md %})

One of my favorite things about being a trans provider is sharing in that moment of discovery with you, and relishing the joy, relief, and opening of possibility that comes with it.

To experience that, of course, you must first book me.

I wrote this booking guide to help those of you who want a meticulously crafted step-by-step walk through to follow for booking time with me. It explains how to start and what to do at every step of the way.

## [Messaging discreetly]({% link resources/for-clients/messaging-discreetly/index.md %})

I'm not here to judge your need to keep what happens in Vegas, well, in Vegas. In fact, as a trans sex worker, I’m here for it.

Unfortunately, a lot of uninformed clients are making some rookie mistakes when trying to keep our messages between us. In this guide, I'll show you my favorite ways to keep messages private and our remote interactions discreet.

## [Using cryptocurrency]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/index.md %})

Cryptocurrency is now a popular way to pay providers. Some providers, like me, even prefer it over every other form of payment.

If you're new to using cryptocurrency, it can feel a little daunting the first time, but it can offer powerful privacy and security benefits. Besides, you only need to set things up once.

My cryptocurrency explainers are designed to help you get set up and ready to send payments from your digital wallet or crypto account(s) as quickly and simply as possible.
