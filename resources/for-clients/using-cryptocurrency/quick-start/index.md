# Violet Rollergirl's Cryptocurrency Quick(est) Start

If you're reading this page, you're ready to pay in crypto. Awesome! Only one problem: you don't have any, and haven't done this before.

Here's a step-by-step guide for what you should do. Many of these steps only have to be done once. After you're set up with these tools and accounts, you can use their "Buy Crypto" feature more easily.

> **&#9432; This page is for clients or customers.** If you are a provider, seller, or vendor you should instead read [{{ site.title }}'s Resources for Providers Using Cryptocurrency (as a Sex Worker)]({% link resources/for-providers/using-cryptocurrency/index.md %}).
>
> **&#9432; This guide presumes you have no existing digital payment services at all.** If you already have a digital payment app that supports cryptocurrency and want to use that one, see...TK.

## Install Zashi Wallet

To use crypto, you first need a wallet app. I recommend [Zashi, the Zcash Wallet](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/){:target="_blank"} app because it:

- runs on both Apple iOS and Android phones
- is stunningly easy to use&mdash;no price graphs or trading features, because it's *actually just a wallet*, not a brokerage service
- is free to use, with zero additional cost in app or service fees&mdash;only standard cryptocurrency network fees apply and only when you send money
- can be made unbelievably private and discreet&mdash;you can enable its built-in Tor protection for ultimate privacy
- supports the most private cryptocurrency available, [shielded Zcash (ZEC)](https://z.cash/learn){:target="_blank"}, which is rapidly gaining popularity in the adult industry, among others

Other wallet apps can work, too, but this one provides the easiest and most secure way to get started.

**Do this** to install Zashi:

1. [Visit the Zashi website](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/){:target="_blank"} on your Android or iOS mobile phone.
1. Click the button corresponding to your mobile platform:
    - If you have iOS: [Click "Download on the App Store"](https://apps.apple.com/app/zashi-zcash-wallet/id1672392439){:target="_blank"}
    - If you have Android: [Click "Get it on Google Play"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.electriccoin.zcash){:target="_blank"}
1. Install the app on your phone as you would any other.
    - You may be asked to sign in to your Apple or Google account, so you may need to know or recover your Apple or Google account password.
1. Once installed, open Zashi.
1. For fresh installs, click the "Create new wallet" button at the bottom of the screen:

    ![Screenshot of the Zashi opening screen with its 'Create new wallet' button.](https://web.archive.org/web/20250512152949if_/https://electriccoin.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1-_-Zashi-Opening-Screen.png){:style="max-width: 400px"}

    (If you already had Zcash saved in another wallet, you can use the other "Restore existing wallet" button to recover your funds.)

### Optionally enable currency conversion in Zashi

Your Zashi wallet will soon show a zero balance, because the wallet is new, and thus empty. At this point, while you can immediately start transacting in ZEC, the Zcash coin, you may want to enable Zashi's currency conversion feature so that you can use a currency unit more familiar to you, such as the United States Dollar (USD).

**Do this** to enable currency conversion in Zashi:

1. From the Zashi main screen, tap the gear icon in the upper-right hand corner to access the app's settings screen.
1. Tap **Advanced Settings >** from the list of top-level menu options.
1. Tap **Currency Conversion** from the list of advanced settings.
1. Tap **Enable** to enable currency conversion from ZEC to your region's traditional currency.
1. Tap **Save changes** at the bottom of the screen to confirm your choice.

    ![Screenshot of the Zashi currency conversion screen.]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/quick-start/screenshot.zashi.currency-conversion.jpeg %}){:style="max-width: 400px;"}

1. Tap the **X** close button at the top left corner of the screen several times to close the currency conversion setting screen.
1. Tap the **&larr;** back button at the top left corner of the screen several times to return to the Zashi main screen.

Your Zashi balance will still show zero because zero ZEC is also zero of every other currency. However, when you obtain some Zcash, and wherever you see a numeric field in the app, you will now have the option to enter amounts in both Zcash and regional currency units.

## Buy ZEC with Coinbase Onramp

Now that you have Zashi (a Zcash wallet), you need some Zcash coins, also called ZEC. Thankfully, Zashi makes it particularly easy to get some. Zashi has an in-app integration with one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase.com, from which you can buy ZEC using a debit card, bank account, or one of numerous other payment methods.

**Do this** to buy ZEC and deposit it directly into your Zashi wallet by using Coinbase Onramp:

1. From the Zashi main screen, tap the **More/&hellip;** button in the center row of buttons. Zashi's "More tools" drawer will appear.
1. Tap **Buy ZEC with Coinbase** to open the Coinbase Onramp website in your phone's default Web browser.

Next, you'll be using Coinbase's services and will be prompted to sign in to or [create your Coinbase account](#create-your-coinbase-account), if you don't already have one.

### Create your Coinbase account

This is the most frustrating part of the entire set up, but thankfully only needs to be done once. Creating your Coinbase account is a multi-step process that requires you to:

- verify an email and phone number
- submit personal information to Coinbase to verify your legal identity
- connect and confirm your payment method
- upload your legal identity documents

Coinbase requires this because, despite the name of its app, Coinbase is *not* a wallet, but rather a banking service. However, once you purchase ZEC and withdraw it from your Coinbase account to your Zashi wallet, the money you've converted gets automatically disassociated from your legal identity thanks to [Zcash and Zashi's auto-shielding functionality](https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-to-help-enable-zcash-shielded-by-default/){:target="_blank"}.

Coinbase periodically changes their account creation process due to changing financial regulations, however the process is usually completed within ten to thirty minutes and they maintain good documentation:

{% include link-as-button.md anchor_text="How to Create a Coinbase Account" url="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/getting-started-with-coinbase/create-a-coinbase-account" target="_blank" %}

You can **follow the on-screen Coinbase Onramp instructions while in Zashi** to create your Coinbase account, or click through the link above to read Coinbase's documentation. Remember that **this step is only needed once** and, when complete, purchasing ZEC and moving it to your Zashi wallet is very smooth.

### Complete your ZEC purchase via Coinbase

Once you complete your [Coinbase set up](#create-your-coinbase-account) or log in, use the Coinbase mobile interface to purchase crypto.

{:.align-center}
{% include link-as-button.md anchor_text="How to Buy Crypto on Coinbase" url="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/buying-selling-or-converting-crypto/how-do-i-buy-digital-currency" target="_blank" %}

Make sure you purchase enough to cover both the price of the service or good you're purchasing as well as Coinbase's service fees, which fluctuate.

If you used Zashi's Coinbase Onramp integration (by accessing the Coinbase screen via Zashi's "Buy ZEC with Coinbase" button), Zashi will now show you a balance in ZEC.

## Ask your provider where to send your payment

Now that you have a balance in ZEC, you need to know where to send this payment so that your provider receives it.

Ask your provider:

> "What's the shielded address for your Zcash wallet?"

{% assign links_group_donations = site.data.social_urls | find: "group_name", "Tip me" | first %}
{% assign zcash_donation_data = links_group_donations.items | where: "label", "Zcash" | first %}
{% assign zcash_donation_addr = zcash_donation_data.url | split: ":" %}

Your provider will send you back one of several things. It will either be:

- a long string of text that you can copy and paste into your clipboard:

      {{ zcash_donation_addr[1]}}

- an image of a QR code that you can save to your phone's gallery:

    ![]({% link images/qr.zcash.violetrollergirl.gif %})

The above are examples of my own [donation addresses]({% link colophon.md %}#cryptocurrency-tips-and-donation-links).

## Send ZEC to your provider

Now that you have your provider's Zcash wallet address, send ZEC there.

**Do this** to send Zcash to your provider:

1. From the Zashi main screen, tap the **Send** button in the center row of buttons.
1. Enter the address your provider gave you into the *Zcash Address* field:
    - If they gave you a long string of text you copied, paste it directly into the field.
    - If they gave you a QR code, save the image, tap the QR code button, and then tap the Image icon to load the image from your gallery. Zashi will read the QR code out of the image, and enter it for you.
1. Enter the amount you are sending in either ZEC or your fiat currency units.
1. Optionally, write a memo or note, and then tap the **Review** button.

    ![Screenshot of the Zashi send screen.]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/quick-start/screenshot.zashi.send.png %})

1. Review and then confirm the transaction with your phone's passphrase, Face ID, or unlock code.

That's it. You can now pay privately with Zcash.
