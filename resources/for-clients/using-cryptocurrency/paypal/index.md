# {{ site.title }}'s guide to using cryptocurrency via PayPal

PayPal is a popular, US-based digital payment service that mostly deals with regional (or "fiat") currency, like the US Dollar. But you can also [use PayPal to buy major cryptocurrencies](https://www.paypal.com/digital-wallet/manage-money/crypto){:target="_blank"} such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, and then use your PayPal-held crypto assets to purchase goods and services from providers or vendors who accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment.

This makes PayPal a very convenient form of paying your provider *even if your provider doesn't have PayPal, themselves!* If your provider accepts cryptocurrency donations, tips, or considerations, then you can use your PayPal account to pay them. This page explains how.
