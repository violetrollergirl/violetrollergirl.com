# {{ site.title }}'s guide to paying your provider in crypto

Hi there!

If you're reading this page, you've probably been steered here by a friend, provider, or directly by me to learn more about why you might want to consider and how you can use cryptocurrency to pay for an appointment or its deposit, or perhaps to pay for a custom photo, video, or other digital good or online service.

Cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly popular with both providers and our clients because, when used smartly, it really does offer big privacy, safety, and financial security assurances. This page is the start of some thorough yet succinct walkthroughs for how to get started with cryptocurrency and then send it to your worker.

> **&#9432; This page is for clients or customers.** If you are a provider, seller, or vendor you should instead read [{{ site.title }}'s Resources for Providers Using Cryptocurrency (as a Sex Worker)]({% link resources/for-providers/using-cryptocurrency/index.md %}).

## Why use cryptocurrency?

There are a lot of reasons you may want to pay your worker in crypto:

- **Privacy:** Cryptocurrency can be made provably more private and discreet than payment apps meaning you needn't associate payments with personally identifying information.
- **Reduced costs:** Once you have crypto, payments can be made directly to your provider, avoiding a payment processing intermediary, which can lower transaction fees.
- **Cross-app interoperability**: If they take crypto, they take crypto, and you don't have to worry about which payment app your provider uses.
- **Provider incentives:** Some providers, like me, offer incentives such as small discounts for using various kinds of privacy-preserving technology. [Ask me about this when you contact me]({% link resources/for-clients/booking-guide/index.md %}#contact)!
- **Volatility can be a windfall**: You can take advantage of crypto's volatility to treat yourself and pay your worker when the price of crypto is high.

Some of these benefits require you to install what's called a self-custodial wallet app ([I like Zashi Wallet](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/){:target="_blank"}) as opposed to using a third-party crypto payment service but in general you can just think of cryptocurrency like digital cash.

One thing is certain: moving forward, far more providers will be using cryptocurrency than any other payment method. Consider preparing for that now.

## Quick(est) Start: no experience required

The rest of this guide covers a lot of different options. For example, if you already have a digital payment app such as PayPal or CashApp, you can use that app to get and pay with cryptocurrency. Eventually, traditional online banking services will also offer cryptocurrency options but, until then, you need some other crypto-supporting app.

**If you have never used a digital payment app of any kind before,** crypto or otherwise, then start at my "[Quick(est) Start]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/quick-start/index.md %})" guide:
