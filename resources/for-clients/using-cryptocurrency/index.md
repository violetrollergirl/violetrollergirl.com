# {{ site.title }}'s guide to paying your provider in crypto

Hi there!

If you're reading this page, you've probably been steered here by a friend, provider, or directly by me to learn more about how you can use cryptocurrency to pay for an appointment or its deposit, or perhaps a different electronic good or service.

Cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly popular with both providers and our clients because, when used smartly, it really does offer big privacy, safety, and financial security assurances. This page is the start of a thorough yet succinct walkthrough of how to get cryptocurrency and then send it to your worker.

> **&#9432; This page is for clients or customers.** If you are a provider, seller, or vendor you should instead read [{{ site.title }}'s Resources for Providers Using Cryptocurrency (as a Sex Worker)]({% link resources/for-providers/using-cryptocurrency/index.md %}).

## Quick(est) Start: no experience required

The rest of this guide covers a lot of different options. But if you have never before touched cryptocurrency, then start at my "[Quick(est) Start]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/quick-start/index.md %})" guide.
