# {{ site.title }}'s guide to using cryptocurrency via Gemini

If you're reading this page, you're ready to pay in crypto. Awesome! Moreover, you've chosen to use **Gemini** as your cryptocurrency exchange. Here's what you should do.

Many of these steps only have to be done once. Once finished, you can simply buy more crypto and then send it to your provider whenever you need to make payments.

> **&#9432; This page is for clients or customers.** If you are a provider, seller, or vendor you should instead read [{{ site.title }}'s Resources for Providers Using Cryptocurrency (as a Sex Worker)]({% link resources/for-providers/using-cryptocurrency/index.md %}).

## In this guide

1. [Create your Gemini account](#create-your-gemini-account)
1. [Add a payment method to your Gemini account](#add-a-payment-method-to-your-gemini-account)
1. [Complete your crypto purchase via Gemini](#complete-your-crypto-purchase-via-gemini)

## Create your Gemini account

Creating your Gemini account is a multi-step process that requires you to:

- verify an email and phone number
- submit personal information to Gemini to verify your legal identity
- upload your legal identity documents

Gemini requires this because, despite claims to the contrary, Gemini is *not* a wallet but rather a banking service. They also periodically change their account creation process due to changing financial regulations but thankfully the process only needs to be performed once and they maintain good [guides on their site](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/sections/38367815447067-Account-Creation-Verification):

Once your Gemini account is created and validated, you can proceed to adding a payment method.

## Add a payment method to your Gemini account

With a Gemini account, you can use their currency exchange services but you still need to supply Gemini with payment information so that you can swap your existing US Dollars (or other local currency) into cryptocurrencies. Gemini enforces different purchase limits on different payment methods, but in general any payment method you have like a debit card or bank account will work. They also have good guides to help you add a payment method, so follow those instructions now:

Depending on the payment method you chose and how you linked it, you may be able to buy crypto immediately or you may need to validate the method with a confirmation loop of some kind. Either way, once linked and activated, you will see your purchase limits on Gemini increase and are ready to get your first crypto coins.

## Complete your crypto purchase via Gemini

Once you [create your Gemini account](#create-your-gemini-account) and [add a payment method to it](#add-a-payment-method-to-your-gemini-account), you can use Gemini to exchange some of your existing local money into crypto. This is Gemini's entire purpose for existing, so they make it really easy to do this.

At this point, Gemini will show you that you have a positive crypto balance in your "wallet" (which is really a bank account, not a true wallet). You can now use that balance to [pay your worker in crypto]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/paying-your-provider/index.md %})!
