## Install Zashi Wallet

To use crypto, you first need a wallet app. I recommend [Zashi, the Zcash Wallet](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/){:target="_blank"} app because it:

- runs on both Apple iOS and Android phones
- is stunningly easy to use&mdash;no price graphs or trading features, because it's *actually just a wallet*, not a brokerage service
- is free to use, with zero additional cost in app or service fees&mdash;only standard cryptocurrency network fees apply and only when you send money
- can be made unbelievably private and discreet&mdash;you can enable its built-in Tor protection for ultimate privacy
- supports the most private cryptocurrency available, [shielded Zcash (ZEC)](https://z.cash/learn){:target="_blank"}, which is rapidly gaining popularity in the adult industry, among others

Other wallet apps can work, too, but this one provides the easiest and most secure way to get started.

**Do this** to install Zashi:

1. [Visit the Zashi website](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/){:target="_blank"} on your Android or iOS mobile phone.
1. Click the button corresponding to your mobile platform:
    - If you have iOS: [Click "Download on the App Store"](https://apps.apple.com/app/zashi-zcash-wallet/id1672392439){:target="_blank"}
    - If you have Android: [Click "Get it on Google Play"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.electriccoin.zcash){:target="_blank"}
1. Install the app on your phone as you would any other.
    - You may be asked to sign in to your Apple or Google account, so you may need to know or recover your Apple or Google account password.
1. Once installed, open Zashi.
1. For fresh installs, click the "Create new wallet" button at the bottom of the screen:

    (If you already had Zcash saved in another wallet, you can use the other "Restore existing wallet" button to recover your funds.)

### Optionally enable currency conversion in Zashi

Your Zashi wallet will soon show a zero balance, because the wallet is new, and thus empty. At this point, while you can immediately start transacting in ZEC, the Zcash coin, you may want to enable Zashi's currency conversion feature so that you can use a currency unit more familiar to you, such as the United States Dollar (USD).

**Do this** to enable currency conversion in Zashi:

1. From the Zashi main screen, tap the gear icon in the upper-right hand corner to access the app's settings screen.
1. Tap **Advanced Settings >** from the list of top-level menu options.
1. Tap **Currency Conversion** from the list of advanced settings.
1. Tap **Enable** to enable currency conversion from ZEC to your region's traditional currency.
1. Tap **Save changes** at the bottom of the screen to confirm your choice.

1. Tap the **X** close button at the top left corner of the screen several times to close the currency conversion setting screen.
1. Tap the **&larr;** back button at the top left corner of the screen several times to return to the Zashi main screen.

Your Zashi balance will still show zero because zero ZEC is also zero of every other currency. However, when you obtain some Zcash, and wherever you see a numeric field in the app, you will now have the option to enter amounts in both Zcash and regional currency units.

## Buy ZEC with Coinbase Onramp

Now that you have Zashi (a Zcash wallet), you need some Zcash coins, also called ZEC. Thankfully, Zashi makes it particularly easy to get some. Zashi has an in-app integration with one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase.com, from which you can buy ZEC using a debit card, bank account, or one of numerous other payment methods.

**Do this** to buy ZEC and deposit it directly into your Zashi wallet by using Coinbase Onramp:

1. From the Zashi main screen, tap the **More/&hellip;** button in the center row of buttons. Zashi's "More tools" drawer will appear.
1. Tap **Buy ZEC with Coinbase** to open the Coinbase Onramp website in your phone's default Web browser.

Next, you'll be using Coinbase's services and will be prompted to sign in to or [create your Coinbase account](#create-your-coinbase-account), if you don't already have one.

Ask your provider:

> "What's the shielded address for your Zcash wallet?"

## Send ZEC to your provider

Now that you have your provider's Zcash wallet address, send ZEC there.

**Do this** to send Zcash to your provider:

1. From the Zashi main screen, tap the **Send** button in the center row of buttons.
1. Enter the address your provider gave you into the *Zcash Address* field:
    - If they gave you a long string of text you copied, paste it directly into the field.
    - If they gave you a QR code, save the image, tap the QR code button, and then tap the Image icon to load the image from your gallery. Zashi will read the QR code out of the image, and enter it for you.
1. Enter the amount you are sending in either ZEC or your fiat currency units.
1. Optionally, write a memo or note, and then tap the **Review** button.

    ![Screenshot of the Zashi send screen.]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/quick-start/screenshot.zashi.send.png %})

1. Review and then confirm the transaction with your phone's passphrase, Face ID, or unlock code.

That's it. You can now pay privately with Zcash.
