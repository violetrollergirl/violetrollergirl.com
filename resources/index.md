# Resources by {{ site.title }}

I high-key love doing sex work. For me, sex work is a mix of the hospitality, service, education, and health jobs I've done in the past. Uniquely, though, it also often makes an immediate, powerful, and positive impact on the lives of the people I get to work with, whether they be my colleagues or clients.

Now that I've been in this industry for a while, I thought I'd start writing down the things I've learned in an effort to make things better for everyone, clients and fellow providers alike.
