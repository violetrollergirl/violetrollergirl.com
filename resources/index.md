I genuinely love doing sex work. I approach sex work as a mix of hospitality, service, education, and health jobs. I've held all of these positions at one point or another, but few of these speak more directly to my personal passions than as a compassionate teacher.

Now that I've been in this industry for a few years, I thought I'd start writing down the things I've learned in an effort to make things better for everyone, providers and clients alike.
