I understand why screening may make you feel anxious. But the thought of spending time alone with me presumably doesn't.

Consider that, until we are physically acquainted, the thought of spending time alone with you may make me slightly anxious, but screening you doesn't.

Screening is *meant* to feel asymmetrical because its purpose is to restore some balance to the way we start out.

The thing about balance is that it's very comfortable. After all, what is grace if not extreme levels of balance? When one is subjected to massive nonerotic power imbalances, it's hard to get comfortable. One can't be as open. Getting naked feels intrusive or violating.

And no one wants that. Right?

Moreover, before you screen, I simply cannot know who I may be speaking with. Since literally anyone might contact me, screning confirms that you are a consenting adult and is unconditionally <em>required</em> to interact with me in any meaningful way. For my safety and comfort, I am simply not comfortable significantly engaging with you otherwise.

[Screening is easy](#screening-options) and you can be done with it after your very [first message](#contact-instructions) to me.
