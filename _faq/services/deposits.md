name: Do you take PayPal/Venmo/CashApp?

Short answer: yes, if you use that app's cryptocurrency option.

Longer answer: since I accept many dozens of cryptocurrencies, and PayPal, Venmo, and CashApp all enable you to buy and send cryptocurrency, you can send me the deposit or the full balance of my consideration in these apps, but you must do so using their cryptocurrency option.

To make this easy, my cryptocurrency payment guides show you how to go about acquiring and transferring crypto from within each of those payment apps:

- [CashApp]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/cashapp/index.md %})
- [PayPal]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/paypal/index.md %})
- [Venmo]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/venmo/index.md %})

If for some reason you cannot use these app's crypto options, I also accept major credit or debit cards, direct cryptocurrency payments, numerous popular gift cards as deposit alternatives.
