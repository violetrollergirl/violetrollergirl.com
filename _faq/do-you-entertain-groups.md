name: Do you entertain groups?

Yes, and happily! I am *enthusiastically* bisexual and love joining fun-loving straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, or pansexual couples for all sorts of adventurous shenanigans! I'm also happy to entertain groups of friends at private parties or similar events.

In either case, I'll simply need each individual participant to [screen](#screening-options) and [reach out to me individually](#dos-and-donts-speak-for-yourself) so I can confirm everyone involved is on the same page and consenting, as I can't accept bookings when communicating through a proxy.

To book me for a group event, simply ask everyone in your party to fill in my [booking form](#booking-inquiry-form) and tell them to note that they are part of the same group.
