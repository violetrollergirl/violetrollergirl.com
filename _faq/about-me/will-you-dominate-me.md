First, let's get on the same page. If you're asking:

1. whether we can do "butt stuff" (in *your* butt), yes, we can! I have an array of toys for this purpose we can enjoy together.
  - What I won't do is *top* you that way with my similar but biological toy of this description.
1. whether I'll receive your submission in a <acronym title="Domination/submission">D/s</acronym> roleplay scene, in brief: no, I don't offer services in which I play a stereotypically dominant role.
  - The one exception to this is chastity keyholding when part of an established dynamic; I do love to please via tease!

### A more nuanced answer

My power role orientation is exclusively submissive but, make no mistake, **my submission is far from meek. I'm more of a power princess than pillow princess**, and I adore co-creating unique dynamics tailor-made to specific fantasies. This can take time and will surely feel intensely intimate (because it is), but the rewards are literally once-in-a-lifetime experiences that turn fantasies into realities in otherwise impossible ways.

My innate confidence, boisterous joy, and shamelessly eager sexuality makes me anything but a cookie cutter submissive partner. I'll happily toy with you if you can give as good as you get, and I relish diving into psychological nuances of complex power play.

If you are simply looking for a one-on-one session with a traditional pro-domme to bottom to or receive specific sensations from, I can refer you to one of my very hot dominant [partners](#friends).

Otherwise, consider that many kinds of play are enhanced by the presence of a fellow submissive like me. These include cuck sessions, co-bottoming, tandem bondage buddies, group play, or creative “sub4sub” vibes.

As part of a duo or [group]({% link _faq/services/do-you-entertain-groups.md %}), I thoroughly enjoy contributing to your demise under the direction of a dominant to whom we are both submitting. Or maybe we are simply exploring as two submissives? Maybe we tie our wrists together, then tug and touch each other all over; let's egg each other on in an endless game of truth or dare; we can amplify our kinks in unexpected ways! Perhaps we'll even invite some friends to watch us—and, perhaps, to touch us. The more creative, the better!

Once you have [successfully screened]({% link _faq/screening/screening-process.md %}), I'm also happy to discuss and suggest more intricate details for unique encounters like these to help you fulfill fantasies you may not even know you have yet!
