[Yes]({% link index.html %}#links-the-erotic-review), but I generally dislike review culture and strongly prefer testimonials. I don't pay much attention to reviews or review boards, either.

In my experience, reviews tend to focus on prurient minutia, leading to mismatched expectations and mediocre experiences. Meanwhile, testimonials do a better job of relaying information about what one client's experience with me was like more wholistically.

Put more crudely, if you're asking about reviews because [you don't already trust]({% link resources/for-clients/booking-guide/index.md %}#who-should-read-this-page) that I'm a real, competent professional and that we'll have a good time together, I invite you to [schedule a curiosity call with me]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-curiosity-call-30-minutes) to explore the possibilities. This will *instantly* reveal far more about our unique chemistry than reading smutty details about how I spent my time with other clients can ever hope to.

I further have no delusions about or interest in controlling your other behavior online. That said, if you have any intentions of publishing details about our time together publicly, I urge you to kindly consider the potential ramifications of doing that on both of us before you do it. At a minimum, I'd appreciate a heads up and a chance to look over whatever you want to publish to ensure our mutual safety.

I *do* appreciate receiving constructive feedback of any kind [discreetly and privately]({% link resources/for-clients/messaging-discreetly/index.md %}) and am always happy to deepen our connection by working with you to realize your fantasies to their fullest!
