My screening process is like many other providers&rsquo; and is required for our mutual safety and comfort. There are no exceptions. <em>Everyone must screen.</em> ([Why?]({% link _faq/screening/why-screen.md %}))

The [Contact page](#contact) on my site offers a summary of your [screening options]({% link resources/for-clients/booking-guide/index.md %}#screening-options). Only <em>one (1)</em> of the listed items is required to successfully pass screening, <em>not</em> all of them. Two of your options are remote and one is in person.

Briefly once more, those options are:

* Attaching a selfie plus a well-established LinkedIn profile link plus a carrier phone number (not a number from a texting app or burner phone) to your next message to me.
* Attaching a selfie of yourself holding a valid government-issued photo ID plus a carrier phone number (not a number from a texting app or burner phone) to your next message to me.
* [Booking me](#contact) for a platonic, meet-and-greet/social-only date. My usual deposit and cancellation [policies]({% link resources/for-clients/booking-guide/index.md %}#policies) will apply.

Again, screening is mandatory; the above listing describes a _minimum requirement_ to pass my screening process. At my sole discretion, I may require additional validation of the information you provide in order to feel comfortable seeing you. The more information you give me before I have to ask for it, the more likely we are to be fantastically compatible. Conversely, <strong>if you are not ready to be screened, please wait until you are before contacting me.</strong>

Keep these points in mind when screening:

{:id="faq-screening-notes"}
* Both remote screening options require a selfie and a carrier (non-burner) phone number; it's not either/or, it's both/and.
* Your selfie must be current, must match your LinkedIn profile pic or ID document photo, and must _not_ be the same pic as your profile or ID document photo itself.
* When sending an ID document, you may redact all information printed on it _except_ your full name, photo, and date of birth (or birth year if that is enough to [prove you are not a minor]({% link resources/for-clients/booking-guide/index.md %}#dos-and-donts-be-of-majority-age)).
* Ensure the text on your ID is readable. Sending images via SMS/txt often degrades them; I recommend [messaging via Signal Private Messenger]({% include signal-booking.url %}).
* To make a stellar first impression, consider providing any verification information you feel comfortable offering, whether or not it is listed above.

Finally, please remember that I consider messages lacking screening information to be incomplete and I may simply not reply to them.
