name: How do I pass your screening process?
---

My screening process is the same as many other providers&rsquo; and is required for our mutual safety and comfort. There are no exceptions. <em>Everyone must screen.</em>

The [Contact](#contact) page on my site describes [your screening options](#screening-options). To summarize that page and your options for screening, they are:

1. Attach a selfie plus a LinkedIn profile link plus a carrier phone number (not a texting app) to your next message to me.
2. Attach a selfie of yourself holding a valid government-issued photo ID to your next message to me.
3. [Book me](#contact) for a platonic, meet-and-greet/social-only date. My usual deposit and cancellation policies apply.

Again, screening is mandatory. <strong>If you are not ready to be screened, please wait until you are before contacting me.</strong> I consider messages lacking screening information to be incomplete and may not reply to them.
