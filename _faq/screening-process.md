My screening process is like many other providers&rsquo; and is required for our mutual safety and comfort. There are no exceptions. <em>Everyone must screen.</em> ([Why?](#faq-why-must-i-screen-screening-makes-me-nervous))

The [Contact](#contact) page on my site offers a summary of [your screening options](#screening-options). Two are remote and one is in person. Briefly once more, those options are:

* Attach a selfie plus a well-established LinkedIn profile link plus a carrier phone number (not a number from a texting app or burner phone) to your next message to me.
* Attach a selfie of yourself holding a valid government-issued photo ID plus a carrier phone number (not a number from a texting app or burner phone) to your next message to me.
* [Book me](#contact) for a platonic, meet-and-greet/social-only date. My usual deposit and cancellation [policies](#policies) will apply.

Keep these points in mind when screening:

{:id="faq-screening-notes"}
* Both remote screening options require a selfie and a carrier (non-burner) phone number; it's not either/or, it's both/and.
* Your selfie must be current, must match your LinkedIn profile pic or ID document photo, and must _not_ be the same pic as your profile or ID document photo itself.
* When sending an ID document, you may redact all information printed on it _except_ your full name, photo, and date of birth (or birth year if that is enough to [prove you are not a minor](#dos-and-donts-be-of-majority-age)).
* Ensure the text on your ID is readable. Sending images via SMS/txt often degrades them; I recommend [booking via Signal Private Messenger]({% include signal-booking.url %}).

Again, screening is mandatory; the above outlines the _minimum requirements_ to pass my screening process, and at my sole discretion I may require additional validation of the information you provide in order to feel comfortable seeing you. <strong>If you are not ready to be screened, please wait until you are before contacting me.</strong> I consider messages lacking screening information to be incomplete and may not reply to them.
