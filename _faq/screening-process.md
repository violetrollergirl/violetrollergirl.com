name: How do I pass your screening process?
---

My screening process is the same as many other providers&rsquo; and is required for our mutual safety and comfort. There are no exceptions. <em>Everyone must screen.</em>

The [Contact](#contact) page on my site offers a summary of [your screening options](#screening-options). Here are a few more details. In brief:

1. Attach a selfie plus a LinkedIn profile link plus a carrier phone number (not a texting app) to your next message to me.
2. Attach a selfie of yourself holding a valid government-issued photo ID to your next message to me.
3. [Book me](#contact) for a platonic, meet-and-greet/social-only date. My usual deposit and cancellation policies apply.

Here are a few things to keep in mind when screening with me:

{:id="faq-screening-notes"}
* Both remote screening options require a selfie and a carrier (non-burner) phone number; it's not either/or, it's both/and.
* Your selfie must be current, must match your LinkedIn profile pic or ID document photo, and must _not_ be the same pic as your profile or ID document photo itself.
* When screening using an ID document, you may obscure all information in the ID _except_ your full name, photo, and date of birth (or birth year if that is enough to prove you are not a minor). If the text on your ID is not readable in the photo you send me, I cannot use it to screen you with.

Again, screening is mandatory. <strong>If you are not ready to be screened, please wait until you are before contacting me.</strong> I consider messages lacking screening information to be incomplete and may not reply to them.
