While I maintain a certain level of professionalism in our correspondence out of necessity before we become too familiar, there's little I love more than injecting a little whimsy into the world! To that end, my [digital Easter egg hunt]({% link colophon/index.md %}#easter-eggs) promises to reward dedicated sleuths with discounts off various kinds of bookings.

My Easter egg challenges are always phrased something like this:

> For $&lt;number&gt; USD amount off your booking of &lt;some condition&gt;, &lt;challenge description&gt;?

Conditions are things like booking a certain amount of time in advance, booking a minimum number of hours, booking a travel date or a date that includes a special activity, or whatever else I'd like to enjoy with you. Some of these conditions are necessarily mutually exclusive. However, others can theoretically be combined.

To make my redemption policy clear:

- Easter eggs are redeemable solely at my discretion. I view this as a way for us to have some fun together first, an educational opportunity second, and a business sale third, in that order.
- In general, I will allow you to redeem one Easter egg discount at a time. At my discretion, I may allow you to redeem multiple complementary discounts in a single session.
- Easter eggs conditions are intended to be very specific. In general, I interpret the conditions of an Easter egg literally and specifically.

I hope you have as much fun searching for these as I've had devising them!
