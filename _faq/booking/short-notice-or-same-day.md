Bluntly, probably not.

While I famously enjoy spontaneous adventures, **I am much more likely to be able to see you "right now," on [short notice, or same-day]({% link index.html %}#short-notice-availability) if we are already acquainted.** This is because it takes time to intake all session details, [complete screening]({% link _faq/screening/screening-process.md %}), send and confirm a [deposit]({% link _faq/booking/what-is-a-deposit.md %}), and actually move our bodies to the same physical place to meet one another. This is to say nothing about possibly needing to also prepare my incall, or at least prepare my body, for your arrival.

You're looking at no less than a ~3 hour turnaround to accomplish all this, at minimum, even in a rare perfect case. Even when I'm on tour, I *still* probably cannot see you immediately precisely because [the whole reason I'm in your area is because I'm pre-booked]({% link _faq/meeting/when-will-you-be-in-my-city.md %}) and am thus focused on my existing commitment with someone else.

The best thing you can do to snag a date opportunistically (or otherwise) is to inquire ahead of time, pre-screen, and keep a line of communication open. [Rescheduling if necessary is also okay]({% link resources/for-clients/booking-guide/index.md %}#if-you-need-to-reschedule-or-cancel), and generally easy to accommodate with minimal fuss as long as you stay communicative.

Put simply, give your life more time, and your life will be more full of pleasure.
