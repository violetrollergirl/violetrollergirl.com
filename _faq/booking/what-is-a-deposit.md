  Like many reserveration-based businesses such as upscale restaurants
  or salons, independent escorts also often require deposits to secure
  appointment times. This page briefly explains why.

A deposit is a portion of my consideration paid in advance to guarantee my time is reserved exclusively for you. I require a deposit to confirm all dates. Until I receive a deposit, our date is marked `tentative` in my (very busy) calendar. It's really no different than any other reservation-based system.

When I commit myself to being with you, whether in person or remotely, I necessarily turn down other invitations and I also (re)arrange my life to ensure that I show up for you at my absolute best and most attentive. If I am hosting us, it may also mean I am spending additional time, and doing additional labor, to ensure we have a clean, calm, well-prepared physical space to spend our time together. If I am traveling to you, it means I am researching logistical details, booking air, rail, or other passage, and so on.

Deposits cover the financial and other costs of these details and enable me to show up gracefully and at peace, ready to enjoy our time together.

My [deposit policy]({% link index.html %}#deposit-policy) is clearly published on the same page as my [rates](#rates).
