**I usually book between 2 days to 2 weeks in advance** and am rarely available for dates on shorter notice than that, especially with new friends.

While I famously enjoy spontaneous adventures, I'm much more likely to be able to see you ["right now," on short notice, or same-day]({% link index.html %}#short-notice-availability) if we are already acquainted.

This is because it takes time to intake all session details, [complete screening]({% link _faq/screening/screening-process.md %}), send and confirm a [deposit]({% link _faq/booking/what-is-a-deposit.md %}), and actually move our bodies to the same physical place to meet one another. This is to say nothing about possibly needing to also prepare my incall, or at least prepare my body, for your arrival.

You're looking at no less than a ~3 hour turnaround to accomplish all this even in a rare perfect case. When I'm on tour, last-minute sessions are also more difficult than you might think precisely because [the whole reason I'm in your area is for a pre-booked date]({% link _faq/meeting/when-will-you-be-in-my-city.md %}) and am thus focused on my existing commitment with someone else.

The best thing you can do to snag a date, whether opportunistically or otherwise, is:

{:.fa-ul}
- <span class="fa-li fa-solid fa-calendar"></span> inquire ahead of time (check my [calendar](#tours)),
- <span class="fa-li fa-solid fa-id-card"></span> pre-screen, and
- <span class="fa-li fa-solid fa-mobile"></span> keep a line of communication open.

[Rescheduling if necessary is also okay]({% link resources/for-clients/booking-guide/index.md %}#if-you-need-to-reschedule-or-cancel), and generally easy to accommodate with minimal fuss as long as you stay communicative.

Put simply, give your life more time, and your life will be more full of pleasure.
