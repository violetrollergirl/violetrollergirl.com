Well, **yes, if you use that app's cryptocurrency option.**

While I do not have a CashApp, PayPal, or Venmo account myself, since I accept many dozens of cryptocurrencies, and these fiat payment apps all enable you to buy and send cryptocurrency, you can send me the deposit or the full balance of my consideration in these apps, but you must do so using their cryptocurrency option.

To make this easy, I've published detailed [cryptocurrency payment guides for clients]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/index.md %}) to show you how to go about acquiring and transferring crypto from within each of those payment apps:

{:.fa-ul}
- [<span class="fa-li fa-brands fa-cash-app"></span> CashApp]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/cashapp/index.md %})
- [<span class="fa-li fa-brands fa-paypal"></span> PayPal]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/paypal/index.md %})
- [<span class="fa-li fa-brands fa-v"></span> Venmo]({% link resources/for-clients/using-cryptocurrency/venmo/index.md %})

If for some reason you cannot use these app's crypto options, I also accept:

{:.fa-ul}
- <span class="fa-li fa-solid fa-credit-card"></span> major credit or debit cards; the charge will show up subtly on your statement
- <span class="fa-li fa-brands fa-bitcoin"></span> direct (on-chain) cryptocurrency payments from any crypto wallet apps; this is an *extremely* discreet option
- <span class="fa-li fa-solid fa-gifts"></span> numerous popular gift cards (for [deposits]({% link _faq/booking/what-is-a-deposit.md %}) only); ask me which and we'll work it out together
