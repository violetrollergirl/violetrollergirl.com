name: Is it okay if I am older/need a wheelchair/Black/genderqueer/etc.?

Absolutely, wholeheartedly, unequivocally <strong>yes, it is okay</strong>, and I am deeply disheartened that the world is still such that it makes you feel the need to ask, although I do understand why you do. What matters to me is the way you treat me. Your race, age, looks, religion, and other information is in no way a determining factor for whether or not I'll meet with you.

The <em>only</em> information you need to disclose about yourself to see me is the information I ask for in my [booking](#contact) and [screening process](#screening-options). The only exception to this is if you have accessibility needs that may prevent me from sufficiently accomodating you at my incall or you have other factors such as medical conditions you'd like to disclose to ensure I can appropriately prepare for and ensure that our time together is enjoyable for us.

Beyond that, I will also keep in mind anything else you do feel is important to share with me and will pay attention to how that can affect our experience together.
