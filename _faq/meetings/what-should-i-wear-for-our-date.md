name: What should I wear for our date?

The short answer is: **wear whatever you're comfortable in. Yes, for real!**

If we're going out, dress in whatever's appropriate for the venue or activity. You can always ask me for my thoughts if you're still unsure.

When we're in private, it's really more about inviting one another into our respective spaces&mdash;physically *and* emotionally&mdash;so I feel like the phrase "come as you are" is very fitting. I personally feel that comfort over curation is a superior approach more often than not.

Regardless, [I'm also always happy to accomodate requests]({% link _faq/meetings/may-i-request-a-special-outfit-or-makeup.md %}). Whatever I'll be in, I'll be looking forward to slowly peeling it off of myself to give you a peek at what's underneath. ðŸ˜˜
