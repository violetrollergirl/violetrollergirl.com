For video dates, the biggest difference from [clothing for in-person dates]({% link _faq/meetings/what-should-i-wear-for-our-date.md %}) (for me anyway), is that they tend to have this feel of, like, "dropping in" to whatever part of our day is happening. This tends to make video dates either have a very premeditated intention or the exact opposite, where we discover the vibe together.

I've had a lot of fun on morning video dates while still in my nightie. I've had fun on video dates late at night after just arriving home from a club! And I've had fun on video dates in between laptop work sessions. And I was more or less dressed as you'd expect for each of those&hellip;at least at first. ;)

As for my date's outfit, in one memorable case, he wore a cozy flannel number and loose shorts and was in his living room. It's also not unusual to wear whatever you might go to bed in, especially if you'll be video'ing from bed. A robe, perhaps, or pajamas! It's also okay, with me at least, if you want to show up naked, though it's courteous to limit that to dates intentionally set up for this kind of experience, i.e., only if we've agreed on that beforehand!

Personally, I prefer to start clothed and undress on camera during our date, because I think that's part of the fun of a real-time, live experience! So if matching me would help your nerves at all, consider when our video date is scheduled for. Early morning, I'll probably be in more casual wear. Mid-day, I'll be in a cute daytime 'fit for turning heads when out and about. Later at night, more likely something befitting my nightlife hobbies!

Regardless, [I'm also always happy to accomodate requests]({% link _faq/meetings/may-i-request-a-special-outfit-or-makeup.md %}). Whatever I'll be in, I'll be looking forward to slowly peeling it off of myself to give you a peek at what's underneath. ðŸ˜˜
