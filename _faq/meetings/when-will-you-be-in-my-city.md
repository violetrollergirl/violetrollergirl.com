name: When will you be in my city?
---

I religiously maintain <a href="#tours">my public travel calendar</a>, which will show you where I'm planning to be and when.

**I only travel where I want to go, or where I'm pre-booked** for an extended date or tour. If I'm coming to your city and you haven't pre-booked a date with me, it either means someone else has booked me, I'm there for a personal reason, or both! You're much more likely to find me in your city if you bring me to it.

It's okay if you're not ready to commit to a longer/travel date with me. We can still get to know each other:

{:.fa-ul}
- <span class="fa-li fa-solid fa-video"></span> [in video dates]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-video-date)
- <span class="fa-li fa-solid fa-phone"></span> [with an introductory call]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-intro-call-and-deposit-20-minutes)

{% include availability-minimums.html %}

Meanwhile, you can [subscribe to my travel calendar]({{ site.data.tours.google_calendar.subscribe_url }}) in your Google Calendar. This way, you can get notifications of when I'll be in a new city.
