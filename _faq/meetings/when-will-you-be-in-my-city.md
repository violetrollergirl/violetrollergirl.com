name: When will you be in my city?
---

I religiously maintain <a href="#tours">my public travel calendar</a>, which will show you where I'm planning to be and when.

Bear in mind that **I only travel where I want to go or where I'm pre-booked.** If you haven't pre-booked a date with me and I'm coming to your city, it means someone else has, or I'm there for a personal reason, or my favorite, both! You're much more likely to find me in your city if you bring me to it.

It's okay if you're not ready to commit to a longer/travel date with me. We can still get to know each other:

{:.fa-ul}
- <span class="fa-li fa-solid fa-video"></span> [in video dates]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-video-date)
- <span class="fa-li fa-solid fa-phone"></span> [with an introductory call]({% link index.html %}#rate-add-ons-and-online-intro-call-and-deposit-20-minutes)

{% include availability-minimums.html %}

Meanwhile, you can even [subscribe to my travel calendar]({{ site.data.tours.google_calendar.subscribe_url }}) in your Google Calendar. This way, you can receive notifications and reminders of when I'll be in a new city.
