name: When will you be in my city?
---

I religiously maintain <a href="#tours">my public travel calendar</a>, which will show you where I'm planning to be and when. You can even subscribe to it directly in your calendaring application of choice, like Google Calendar, and get notified of when I'll be in a new city. However, you are much more likely to find me in your city if you bring me to it!
