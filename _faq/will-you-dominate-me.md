name: Will you dominate me?

In brief, no, I don't offer services in which I play a stereotypically dominant role. The one exception to this is chastity keyholding; I do love to please via tease!

A slightly longer answer is that while I am never dominant, my own style of submission is not meek. My innate confidence, boisterous joy, and shamelessly eager sexuality means that I am far from a cookie cutter submissive partner. I know what I like, what I want, and how to entice you to want it, too.

I'm more of a power princess than a pillow princess. I'll happily toy with you if you can give as good as you get, and I relish diving into psychological nuances of complex power play.

I especially adore building a unique dynamic tailor-made to our specific fantasies. This will take some time and will feel intensely intimate (because it is), but the rewards are literally once-in-a-lifetime experiences that turn fantasies into realities in otherwise impossible ways.

If you are simply looking for a one-on-one session with a traditional pro-domme to bottom or receive specific sensations such as impact play for a traditional "scene," I'll refer to my very hot [friends](#friends).

Otherwise, consider that many kinds of play are also enhanced by the presence of a fellow submissive. These include cuck sessions, co-bottoming, group play, or creative “sub4sub” vibes. As part of a duo or group, I thoroughly enjoy contributing to your demise under the direction of a dominant to whom we are both submitting.

Or maybe we are simply exploring as two submissives? Maybe we tie our wrists together, then tug and touch each other all over; let's egg each other on in an endless game of truth or dare; we can amplify our kinks in unexpected ways! Perhaps we'll even invite some friends to watch us—and, perhaps, to touch us.

The more creative, the better! Once you have successfully screened, I am also happy to discuss and suggest more intricate details for such unique encounters to help you fulfill fantasies you don't even know you have yet!
